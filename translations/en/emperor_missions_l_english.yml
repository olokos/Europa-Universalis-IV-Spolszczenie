Since then, the festivities have become even grander, the costumes more ornate, and the celebrations all the more decadent. Quite frankly, its magnificence is all out of proportion for what it's supposed to celebrate, but we can use that to our advantage.

Although they started off primarily dedicated to charitable activities, over the ages their purposes have gradually expanded, and now many of them support such varied activities as music, the arts, and medicine.

These documents are essential for both our own diplomatic efforts and for maintaining the competitive advantage of our merchants abroad, but it is an increasingly common practice for copies of relazioni to be published and made available to anybody willing to pay a high price for them.

It outlines the duties of the Doge, and states the limits on the Doge's powers. Over the years, however, some of the checks have... waned, a little. If we were to draft a new primissione ducale, one that more firmly restates our values and the roles envisioned for the Doge, not only would our government be strengthened, but more virtuous candidates for office might step forward as well."

 emp_ven_contest_genoese_trade_desc: "Genoa has long been a thorn in our side, and the growing power of Western Mediterranean trade is simply strengthening their hand and making them more of a threat to us. We must do something about their sources of trade- if we can cut into their income, they won't be nearly wealthy enough to seriously contest our power, and that will enable us to humiliate them further."
 emp_ven_the_francocracy_title: "The Francocracy"
 emp_ven_the_francocracy_desc: "Following the Fourth Crusade, we established several lordships in former Byzantine lands, and for a while helped maintain their presence in the region. The Greeks denigrated these realms as the 'Frankokratia', the rule of the 'Franks', but for us, they were useful tools for extending our power. It was a grand time to be a Venetian. The time is ripe to re-establish our presence in Constantinople, the real center of power in the area, but this time we should play a more active role in the region's administration."
 emp_ven_challenge_papal_supremacy_title: "Challenge Papal Power"
 emp_ven_challenge_papal_supremacy_desc: "We have long maintained a certain understanding with the Papacy. The Pope would not meddle in the affairs of our churchmen, and we would not meddle in the affairs of the Pope. These days, however, the Papacy has grown more assertive, even as our own power grows, and has begun involving itself in Church affairs across Europe. It is time for us to remind the Pope of our old arrangement, and check the Papacy's grasps at power."

 emp_ven_control_the_means_of_transaction_desc: "Our booming commerce is handicapped by the arbitrarily dictates of local rules, who cannot appreciate the full benefits of our mutual arrangements, and insist on such petty hindrances as taxes, surcharges, and the supremacy of their laws over our agents. Clearly, the only way to settle this impasse is to assert our own administration in these lucrative lands."
