It is time to raise troops who are ready to fight for the independence of our country!"

Over the centuries, the connection between our people and Kievan Rus has become loose at best.\nHowever, the Russians of Muscovy have proven to be a formidable threat. It is in our interest to conquer their center of power to protect Sweden from their influence. The historical connection to the city is just a neat bonus."

However, the pestilence eventually reached Norway, and 60% of their population found a miserable death in 1348. Ever since this event, the Norwegian Crown degraded in importance and their nobility was replaced with Danes over time.\nNowadays, the Crown of Norway is the least important one of the three Kingdom titles. But voices within Norway wish to return their beloved country back to glory, and wish for more recognition within the Kalmar Union."

During the war between Denmark and the Hansa in 1435, Sweden experienced economical issues caused by the Hansa. As a result of it, the miner and nobleman Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson raised a small army of revolters and rebels. The Kalmar Union as we know it today might have ceased to exist already if it was not for his premature death.\nIt is clear that the Swedish nobility is no longer happy with [Root.GetAdjective] involvement in their affairs. Fortunately for us, some of the Swedish ruling class are pro-unionist. We could use our resources to persuade the remaining nobility and convert them into pro-unionists too."

The nobles are making themselves highly unpopular with the Swedish commoners.\nWhile this Pretender War will be highly costly to our treasury and our manpower, it will at least show the Swedes that the [Root.GetAdjective] rule is not one of tyranny but of justice - unlike the one their nobilites try to enforce."

 flavor_dan.124.desc: "Ever since the days of the Roman Empire, kings and generals relied on mercenaries for their wars, and [Root.GetName] is no exception to this. But as time went on, the governments of Europe established the concept of standing armies; military forces which are recruited from their own people who can be called to arms in times of need. Our advisors are divided. On the one hand the usage of a standing army guarentees that we are using professional and loyal soldiers for the defense of our ambitions. On the other hand, we would have to be ready to sacrifice good [Root.GetAdjective] lives for our goals.\nIn the end it is up to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to make the final decision."

It is not quite certain how they achieved it, but they claim they only seek Imperial Protection from Poland.\nWhile more members in the Empire is always a welcome sight, the Teutonic Order has a rather bad reputation for causing trouble.

They wish to seek Imperial Protection from Poland and Lithuania, and want to join the Empire until they are able to defeat the Poles.\nThe Order used to be quite popular amongst the North German dukes and counts when they were still on a crusade against the Baltic Pagans. However, their recent history of wars against Poland and an already Christianized Lithuania gave these knights a rather bad reputation. No longer are they fighting for the Holy See but for personal gains, and the counties bordering the Order fear aggression from the Order's side.\nWhile more members in the Empire is always a welcome sight, accepting the Order into the Empire - even if it is only temporarily - might make [Emperor.Monarch.GetName] of [Emperor.GetName] rather unpopular with the duchies which border this order."

Although both our faiths are Christian, there are some irreconcilable differences between them.\nThe [Root.GetBurghersOrFallbackName] suggested to let them practice in peace, and in return the Orthodox Ruthenians might accept our rule without a second thought.\nThe [Root.GetChurchOrFallbackName], however, advises that we purge this heresy before others fall for this foreign faith in our country."

 flavor_teu.37.t: "The Fate of [295.GetName]"
 flavor_teu.37.desc: "Due to the constant decline of the petty Byzantine Empire, the city of [295.GetName] has become somewhat of a religious center of the Orthodox faith. Some of our knights yearn for the looting of the city in the fashion of the Fourth Crusade in 1204. However, doing so might result only in a vast revolt of the Muscovite Russians against us.\nAnother suggestion was to repurpose the churches instead and convert the people to Catholicism while the Orthodox Patriarchs are getting dispossessed. This will result into a religious revolt, though a smaller one than a sacking.\nFinally, one last suggestion from our knights is to integrate the Muscovite Russians into our state, and help them rebuild their city. Surely, it will get us the goodwill of the Russians, but future conversion attempts in [295.GetName] or in the near area might meet harsh resistance."

Obviously, these knights have lost their mind, but the decline of the Orthodox faith in Constantinople and the victories of the Teutonic Order speak for themselves. While we could continue in our old ways, the signs suggest that God may truly be on the side of Catholocism."

The Teutonic Order has won where so many of our Christian brothers have failed. The Christian subjects of the Sultanate have witnessed our victories; they saw the defeats of the Ottoman armies, and now they prepare themselves to throw the Turkish shackles off them!"

Inspired by the brutal conqueror Genghis Khan and driven by our holy mission to convert the infidels, our state expanded more and more into the far eastern steppes. By now, a normal administration is almost impossible were it not for the most important tool in our order: the horse.\nWithout even noticing it, we have become what once threatened the Christendom: a horde, stretching from the cold waters of the Baltics all the way to the hot deserts of Central Asia.

Although this mission was accomplished decades ago, we have decided to stay in the land of the Old Prussians and make it our home - however, much to the displeasure of Poland. In the last 40 years our Order has fought four wars against Poland and its allies. As a result of the recent setbacks resulting from these wars, the rich cities of Prussia are plotting against our authority. The Prussian Confederation is a looming threat which will need to be dealt with swiftly...\n\nBut not all looks grim for us. The Teutonic Order is at the crossroads of its future.

After finishing the mission '§YDefeat Poland§!' we will receive an event, which allows the replacement of the Branching Missions with missions from one of the two following paths:\n\n§YPrussian Path§!\nThe Prussian Path is one about secularizing and dissolving the Teutonic Order, and reforming into the nation of §YPrussia§!. It will revolve around maintaining one of the strongest armies of history, as well as expanding the development of the Prussian lands. It will also lead into a new branching path, which will let you decide if you want to do the §YDiplomacy of the HRE§!, §YExpand into Germany§! and unify the Germans or §YForge your own Fate§! as the Kingdom of Prussia in Poland and Ruthenia.\n\n§YCrusader Path§!\nThe Crusader Path is one about sticking to the purpose of the Order, which is the Chrstianizing of Heathens and Heretics. Your mission tree will lead you on a campaign of conquest and coversion of §YEastern Europe§! as well as the §YSteppes of Central Asia§!."
 flavor_teu.43.a.tt: "We will accept the §YTeutonic Order§! to join the Holy Roman Empire without any condition.\nNeighbors of the Order, which are part of the Empire, might feel threatened by this choice.\n\nEvery neighbor of §Y[TEU.GetName]§! who is part of the Holy Roman Empire loses §R150§! opinion of §Y[Root.GetName]§!."

While technically a vassal of the Teutonic Order, the Livonian Order has remained mostly autonomous.\nHowever, our order has its fair share of challenges. The Kalmar Union - the very hungry Lions of the North - seek our subjugation. The Lithuanians, backed by their Polish allies, want to annex the Baltic lands, and the Novgorodians to our east consider expanding westwards.\nBut that is not all. In 1435, the bishoprics formed the Livonian Confederacy under the rule of Riga, and started steering precious resources away from us for their own gain.\n\nBut not all looks grim for us. Times change, and the Livonian Order is at the crossroads of destiny. If we manage to end this confederacy, and manage to push our enemies back then our state can make a choice of which path we shall follow."
 flavor_liv.0.a.tt: "The §YLivonian Order§! has a unique mission tree, which is more flexible than other mission trees. After finishing the mission '§YStrengthen Our Authority§!' we will receive an event, which allows us to replace the Branching Missions with missions from one of the two following paths:\n\n§YLivonian Path§!\nThe Livonian Path is one about secularizing and dissolving the Livonian Order, and reforming into the nation of §YLivonia§!. It will revolve around the development of the §YBaltic§! region and the colonization of the §YNew World§!. It will also allow us to form our own §YGovernment§!, which is forged by our needs and actions.\n\n§YCrusader Path§!\nThe Crusader Path is one about sticking to the purpose of the Order, which is the Chrstianizing of Heathens and Heretics. Your mission tree will lead you on a campaign of conquest and coversion of §YRussia§! and establishing a Catholic Empire in §YEastern Europe§!."
 flavor_liv.1.t: "The Future of the Livonian Order"
 flavor_liv.1.desc: "Our Order managed to get the Livonian Confederacy at bay, and secured a future. However, it is apparent that our Order is lacking a proper direction. The dawn of a new era is approaching, and it is now more than ever time to choose how the direction of our state shall look like."
 flavor_liv.1.a: "The time of the crusades is over. We shall become a secularized realm!"

 flavor_liv.2.t: "Dissolution of a Bishopric"
 flavor_liv.2.desc: "Our army is ready to enforce the dissolution of one of the members of the Livonian Confederacy. The question is: which Bishopric should be our target?"

 flavor_liv.2.b: "We must crush the Bishopric of Ösel."
 flavor_liv.2.c: "It is time to end the Bishopric of Courland."

 flavor_liv.2.e: "We cannot dissolve any of these Bishoprics..."
 flavor_liv.2.f: "What Bishoprics?"
 flavor_liv.3.t: "Purchase of a Bishopric"

 flavor_liv.4.t: "Secularization of the Livonian Order"
 flavor_liv.4.desc: "We are an Order of knights, which had only one goal: the Christianization of the Baltic lands - and we achieved this goal. However, with the Reformation spreading it has become more and more apparent to us that our order has lost its point, and a crusade against fellow Christians is more than absurd according to our advisors.\nMaybe it is finally time to dissolve the Livonian Order as we know it, and form a proper kingdom - the Kingdom of Livonia."

 flavor_liv.5.a: "Our both countries shall stand united against any threat!"
 flavor_liv.6.t: "The Creation of a new Government"
 flavor_liv.6.desc: "Our secularization made our country into a monarchy like many others around us. However, as our state is relatively young in comparison, we lack the experiences and traditions our neighbors have made during their lifetime. Even our allies in the Prussian lands have started to introduce systems of efficient administration to their monarchy.\nIt is time that we learn from the experiences of our neighbors, and shape a monarchy which suits our needs."
 flavor_liv.6.a: "Les us found a Monarchy worthy to be part of Livonia!"
 flavor_liv.7.t: "Livonia declares the end of the Schism"
 flavor_liv.7.desc: "Having the Russian lands fallen into Catholic hands, the knights of Livonia have declared that the Great Schism has ended and that all the Christendom shall follow the leadership of the Papacy. This is however not something that the Pope himself has endorsed, so the validity of the declaration is still under doubt, but these conquests may be an indication that God himself favors Catholicism."
 flavor_liv.7.a: "God's intention is clear, the Pope shall lead."
 flavor_liv.7.b: "Some mere knights cannot dismiss the Patriarchs."
 flavor_liv.8.t: "Decline of the Lübeck Trade Dominance"
 flavor_liv.8.desc: "We gained access to the Lübeck trade through various means and ways, which allowed us to grow in wealth and power. So much so that we finally managed to expand westwards, and acquired a center of trade near Lübeck itself.\nDue to our progress, the Hansa felt threatened and started limiting our access to their market now."
 flavor_liv.8.a: "Quite unfortunate."
 flavor_liv.13.t: "Question of Teutonic-Livonian Relations"
 flavor_liv.13.desc: "The Teutonic Order have been our brothers in faith and in arms since the foundation of both our orders. Working together with them we were able to christianize these regions, but our cooperation could be increased even further. If we tighten our mutual bonds, the benefits for the Faith could be unmeasurable."
 flavor_liv.13.a: "Let us strengthen the bond between us, and see each other eye to eye."
 flavor_liv.13.a.tt: "[Root.Capital.GetName] gets the triggered modifier '§YEmbassy of the Orders§!' until the end of the game, giving the following effects when active:\nDiplomatic Upkeep: §G+1§!\nYearly Army Professionalism: §G+0.5%§!\nLocal Manpower Modifier: §G+25.0%§!\nLocal Development Cost: §G-5.0%§!"
 flavor_liv.13.b: "Our alliance with the Teutonic Order is just a means for the end."
 flavor_liv.14.t: "Bound between Livonia and the Teutonic Order"
 flavor_liv.14.desc: "The knights of Livonia have been our brothers in faith and in arms since the foundation of both our orders. Working together with them we were able to christianize these regions, but our cooperation could be increased even further. The Livonian knights have come to us to that effect and established a headquarter in our capital. We should return the favor."
 flavor_liv.14.a: "This might be a fruitful connection"
 flavor_liv.15.t: "Militarization of the Knights"
 flavor_liv.15.desc: "Our Order started already as a military order, but we have managed to improve the organization and administration behind its knights. As such, our troops are already a proper army instead of just a group of crusader knights."
 flavor_liv.15.a: "Our Knights will triumph."
 flavor_liv.16.t: "An Army with a Monastery"
 flavor_liv.16.desc: "Our recent military reforms have improved our capabilities quite a lot, but there is still room for improvement. By completely embracing the militarization of our Order we could have an army comparable to any other major country. We would turn from some monasteries with an army to an army with monasteries."
 flavor_liv.16.a: "Let's embrace it."
 flavor_liv.16.b: "Let's not go overboard."
 flavor_liv.17.t: "Second Battle on the Ice"
 flavor_liv.17.desc: "Our defeat at the hands of Prince Alexander Nevsky of Novgorod and their allies from Vladimir in 1242 had been a stain in our military history. Now the tables have turn and we have managed to make them taste defeat instead."
 flavor_liv.17.a: "May this serve as a warning to all of our enemies."
 flavor_liv.18.t: "A Crusading Kingdom"
 flavor_liv.18.desc: "Our crusading state have greatly surpased its initial objectives and we have expanded to great lengths. We have gone beyond a mere crusading state and have become a true Crusading Kingdom."
 flavor_liv.18.a: "Long Live Livonia!"
 flavor_liv.18.b: "Let us stay humble."
 flavor_liv.20.t: "Administrative Chaos in the Office"
 flavor_liv.20.desc: "Although our [Root.GovernmentName] usually has a rather efficient administration, there are just these days where seemingly nothing works. Bureaucrats are overloaded with the handling our territory. Mayors forget to perform their duties. In other words: we are currently experiencing more chaos than ever expected.\nIn the end, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] has to step in to organize the administration."
 flavor_liv.20.a: "Concentrate all of our efforts into the administration!"
 flavor_liv.20.b: "Establish subjects, which will govern the territory for us."
 flavor_liv.20.b.tt: "Every owned state province gains §R20§! Local Autonomy."
 flavor_liv.20.c: "We need the military to help us out here."
 flavor_liv.20.c.tt: "Every owned state province gains §G-20§! Local Autonomy."
 flavor_liv.21.t: "Questions of Warfare"
 flavor_liv.21.desc: "War is a costly matter. It takes resources, men and effort, and victory is not always assured. Although mercenaries were the common and popular way to pursue victories on the battlefield, the states around us started introducing proficient, standing armies which are trained for the heat of battle."
 flavor_liv.21.a: "Mercenaries are just as good for war."
 liv_merc_focus: "Renewed Mercenary Contracts"
 desc_liv_merc_focus: "Our decision to focus on a mercenary heavy army motivated our administration to renew our mercenary contracts."
 flavor_liv.21.b: "A standing army? We have marines for that."
 liv_marine_focus: "Focus on Marines"
 desc_liv_marine_focus: "Our decision to focus more on the navy than on a standing army introduced many soldiers to the life on the high seas."
 flavor_liv.21.c: "We should indeed invest into a standing army."
 flavor_liv.22.t: "[Root.GetAdjective] Estates demand Privileges"
 flavor_liv.22.desc: "Our [Root.GovernmentName] is making progress in its pursue of creating a government suited to the needs of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] people.\nHowever, not everyone can appreciate the beauty of governmental progress. The great estates of [Root.GetName] have assembled in the court of [Root.Monarch.GetName], and threaten our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] with a coup if we do not grant them privileges in our new state."
 flavor_liv.22.a: "Grant them useless rights. They will not notice it."
 flavor_liv.22.b: "Assure them their privileges."

 flavor_liv.24.t: "Religious Debate within [Root.GetName]"
 flavor_liv.24.desc: "Religion plays a great role within our society. But ever since we abandoned our monastic roots, it took a step back, and the ruling family has become the focus of the public attention in [Root.GetName].\nThe Clergy wants to change it, and is debating with our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the other estates to make religion a bigger part of our country."
 flavor_liv.24.a: "The clergy is right. We should put more emphasize on religion."
 flavor_liv.24.a.tt: "Religious Focus of the State"
 flavor_liv.24.b: "Religion is part of our state, yes. But it is underneath the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."

 flavor_liv.25.t: "The Role of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 flavor_liv.25.desc: "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is a prestigious title, and its role is in most other [Root.GovernmentName] clear: ruler of the state. However, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] could be so much more. Throughout history there were many kings who administrated the state on their own, overviewed diplomacy with foreign countries and led armies to victory.\nThe question is what path our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] shall take..."
 flavor_liv.25.a: "The treasury and the administration need somebody with a clear head - like me."

 flavor_pol.32.d: "It is no secret that power and influence have an adverse effect on people. However, power wielded carefully and guided by a steady hand can yield tremendously positive results for our foreign and domestic affairs. The infantile nobles of Lithuania have been pestering us with their refusal to participate in the Sejm Diets and congregations, grinding the entire process to a halt. If they do not comprehend the diplomatic tongue, perhaps they would be more atuned to a show of strength at the expense of their own lands?"

 flavor_hsa.6.d: "The basis for the market's popularity was the rich herring fishing around the Falsterbo Peninsula. Legend tells that the herring fishery off the Scanian coast was so rich, that one could scoop up the fish with one's hands. After a visit to the region in 1364, the French crusader Philippe de Mézières wrote: \"Two months a year, that is in September and October, the herring travel from one sea to the other through the Sound, by order of God, in such large numbers that it is a great wonder, and so many pass through the sound in these months, that at several places one can cut them with a dagger.\" \n\nEmbarking on the market as a competitor to Skane would probably prove to be very profitable. However, despite the abundance of marine life in the pass, many advisors in our court suggest we best stay loyal to our main export, Lubeckian naval supplies."

Around 1350 a Kontor of the Hanseatic League was established there, and Tyskebryggen became the centre of the Hanseatic commercial activities in Norway. Since then, the League lost its touch and the offices were granted to other local and foreign merchants. \n\nAround [GetYear], an office of the Hanseatic League was established in Bryggen. As the town developed into an important trading centre, the wharfs were improved and the buildings of Bryggen were gradually taken over by the Hanseatic merchants. The warehouses were used to store goods, particularly stockfish from northern Norway, and cereal from Europe."
 flavor_hsa.7.a: "Entrepreneurship and cooperation at their finest!"
 flavor_hsa.8.t: "The Hanseatic Town of Visby"
 flavor_hsa.8.d: "Visby lies on the Island of Gotland, about 100 km east of the mainland in the Baltic Sea. The settlement, dating from the Viking Age, was formed on a shore with a natural harbour, sheltered by steep cliff formations. Gotlandic merchants utilized it as a strategic point in trade within the Baltic Sea. They allied for the protection of their trading posts which developed into a federation or Hansa. By the 12th century Visby had come to dominate this trade, and all the commercial routes of the Baltic were channelled through the town. After the foundation of Lübeck in 1143, German merchants began to expand their sphere of interest into the Baltic Sea and settled in Visby. It became the only trading place on the island with the privilege of trading with German towns and hence the main centre of the Hanseatic League. During the 13th century, Visby changed from a seasonal trading place into an impressive metropolis, enclosed by a strong defensive wall and increasingly divorced from its rural hinterland. The wall imposed new restrictions on the Gotlandic traders creating tensions that led to civil war in 1288. German, Russian and Danish traders built stone warehouses in parallel rows from the harbour and the community expanded with guild houses, churches and residences. In the 14th century, Visby began to lose its leading position in the Hanseatic League due to plague around 1350 and invasion by the Danish army under King Valdemar Atterdag in 1361. Warfare and piracy in the 15th century and changed trading routes bypassing Visby severely affected trade on Gotland and the economy of Visby deteriorated. However, the recent reacquisition of Gotland by the Hanseatic Merchants will surely breathe a gust of fresh air throughout the island's markets and beyond."

 flavor_hsa.9.t: "The Danzig Confederation"
 flavor_hsa.9.d: "The Prussian Confederation (German: Preussischer Bund, Polish: Zwiazek Pruski) was an organization formed on 21 February 1440 at Marienwerder by a group of 53 nobles and clergy and 19 cities in Prussia, to oppose the arbitrariness of the Teutonic Knights. It was based on the basis of an earlier similar organization, the Lizard Union established in 1397 by Chełmno Land nobles. \n\nIn 1454, the leader of the Confederation, Johannes von Baysen (Jan Bazynski), formally asked King Casimir IV Jagiellon, to incorporate Prussia into the Kingdom of Poland as a fief. This marked the beginning of the Thirteen Years' War between the Order's State and Poland, with the Prussian cities financing the military costs of the latter. \n\nDespite the conflicts between the aforementioned parties, Danzig now lies within our sphere of influence. As a result, the merchants of the City and members of the Confederation have come to our court in Lubeck to barter and ask for access to our prosperous markets."

 flavor_hsa.10.d: "We were once dubbed the “Queen of the Hanseatic League” and as the President, our Mayor of Lübeck guided the destinies of the medieval Hanseatic League, which was never officially founded nor dissolved. Our League houses merchants from all over Europe and they meet annually to make decisions as 43 of the 67 Hanseatic Days (Hansetage) took place in Lübeck, which was positioned geographically favorable. This resulted in us taking the leading role in the Hanseatic League. The hub of power was the Town Hall erected in [GetYear] which serves as the central assembly and deliberation chamber for matters of the League. It is one of the most famous Gothic brickwork structures. With its impressive facade, it resembles a fairytale castle. The shape of the building has been defined over three centuries: from 1226 to even today, a succession of new elements were added, and there were conversions and extensions such as the sandstone arcade, the raising of the striking facade with its distinctive circular holes for improved wind resistance as well as the bay window and impressive grand staircase."

It is in fact a series of fortifications added over time to further protect the inhabitants and their riches inside. In particular, the Holstentor is split into 3 layers: the Inner, Middle and Outer Gates. Each was built as a response to the advances of gunpowder and siege equipment, the latest addition of fortifications will surely be adequate and proven to be a sound investment for the safeguard of our wealth. \n\nThe Burgtor is the oldest of the four former gates of the medieval city fortifications of Lübeck. At the end of the Große Burgstraße, located at the northern end of the historic old town of Lübeck, you will find the castle gate, which was built in the late Gothic style. In addition to the more famous Holsten Gate, the Burgtor is the second largest city gate of the Lübeck city fortifications. The Lübeck Castle Gate takes its name from the old Lübeck Castle high above the Trave, which was converted into a castle monastery in 1227."

 flavor_hsa.12.t: "Theory of Mercantilism"
 flavor_hsa.12.d: "Mercantilism is an economic theory that advocates government regulation of international trade to generate wealth and strengthen national power. Merchants and the government work together to reduce the trade deficit and create a surplus. Mercantilism, a form of economic nationalism, funds corporate, military, and national growth. It advocates trade policies that protect domestic industries. In mercantilism, the government strengthens the private owners of the factors of production. \n\nThese four factors of production are entrepreneurship, capital goods, natural resources and labor. Mercantilism establishes monopolies, grants tax free status, and grants pensions to favoured industries. It imposes tariffs on imports. It also prohibits the emigration of skilled labor, capital, and tools. It doesn't allow anything that could help foreign companies. In return, businesses funnel the riches from foreign expansion back to their governments. Its taxes pay for increase national growth and political power."

 flavor_hsa.13.t: "The Hanseatic Cog"
 flavor_hsa.13.d: "The Hansa used a ship called the cog for sea transport. It was a bulky freighter with one mast and a square sail. A helm at the stern and a flat floor made it possible to ship in low water. Unlike the Nordic longboats they were more economical to use. A cog could transport a relatively large amount of cargo with just a small crew, up to 90 tons. It was produced relatively quickly and inexpensively at that time. \n\nLarger loads could be transported more cheaply and by a smaller crew than previously. That's what made this type of ship so successful. There were cogs of different sizes, between 15 and 25 m in length, 5-8 m wide and with a moulded depth of 3-5 m. The measurement of the capacity of a cog was called “last”, equivalent to 2 tons. This was the capacity of a carriage drawn by four horses. A small cog of 50 last was able to carry the same load as an endless convoy of 50 waggons pulled by 200 horses. There were also cogs twice as big. With the castle (aft) the surroundings could be observed well. Due to the lack of keel, the cog could also fall to ground during low tide, but it was also restricted to navigate because of that. A cog could only ride with the wind and not cross the wind."

 flavor_hsa.14.t: "Adler von Lubeck"
 flavor_hsa.14.d: "The Adler von Lübeck (Eagle of Lübeck), also called Der Große Adler or Lubscher Adler, is a 16th-century warship of the Hanseatic city of Lübeck, Germany. Adler von Lübeck was one of the largest ships in the world at her time, being 78.30 m long overall and displacing 2-3,000 tons. The war galleon was built by Lübeck during the Northern Seven Years' War to escort her convoy of merchant ships in the Baltic and North Sea. \n\nSuch naval prowess displayed by Adler will certainly be the object of envy in the eyes of our rivals. To safeguard its legitimacy and aura of invincibility would mean that our nation will continue to benefit from its glorious name."

 flavor_hsa.16.d: "The city of Danzig, now lying firmly in our grasp, used to be a hub of trade under the once-mighty Hanseatic League, situated in Lubeck. Since then, the League has fallen from grace due to a plethora of factors and has had its power in the Baltic and beyond challenged. Despite these shortcomings, recent developments around the banks of Germany and the Baltic have led to the League regaining its standing. Once again, the powerful merchants of the Hansa come to Danzig, with a lucrative offer..."
 flavor_hsa.16.a: "Offer them a lucrative deal!"
 flavor_hsa.16.b: "Forget about it!"
 flavor_hsa.17.t: "A Royal Offer for Danzig"
 flavor_hsa.17.d: "The Polish court has approached our merchants with a lucrative offer. Given the expansive nature of our trade and the recent developments of the Hanseatic League regaining its old glory, they wish to parlay in regards to granting the city of Danzig back to the League. Such a diplomatic move will certainly come at a cost, but it might be wise to consider it and attempt to avoid any unnecessary bloodshed towards or against the Polish crown and its mighty army, lest we risk the destruction of what we struggled to build thus far."

Recent developments on the diplomatic fronts have resulted in the [236.Owner.GetAdjective] monarchy granting certain Lubeckian individuals the ability to not only freely travel to and from London but also the green light to establish offices around the most crowded areas of the city's port.

 flavor_hsa.20.d: "The regulation of timber and workforce in the maritime sector was once the lifeblood of our great republic. During the early 15th century however, we lost the monopoly on shipbuilding and the goods associated to it and thus lost the firm grasp on the seas themselves. Despite numerous setbacks the Hansa has recently rediscovered its long-lost power in the trade of naval supplies by re-establishing control over the markets of our home city and abroad. What this means for our future not many can clearly say, but the positive development of our city returning to its roots is certainly a sign of prosperous times to come!"

 flavor_hsa.21.d: "George (or Georg) Giese was a prominent Hanseatic merchant, who managed his family's office at London's Steelyard for at least 12 years. Raised in the Giese family and son to Albrecht Giese (another famous and powerful Hanseatic mayor of Danzig and merchant in London) his family had an office in London, which, at the time was the center of European trade. Situated in the Steelyard, the London branch of the Hansa, the Giese family office was part of an enclave where Hanseatic and foreign merchants congregated. \n\nThere, George studied the mercantile craft and excelled in his studies, graduating one academy after another in flying colours. Eventually he would come to be the head of the Steelyard's operations for decades, proving himself a capable administrator and a skillful diplomat as well."

 flavor_hsa.22.d: "The Hanseatic League is a congregation, or rather a loose alliance, between many merchants from all across the territories of the mighty Holy Roman Empire and beyond. Many merchants have come and gone, some more gifted at making legendary fortunes and securing themselves a spot at the pages of history and others less so. \n\nFew however, have left such a dent in history as Albrecht Moldenhauer, a genius merchant from our city of Lubeck. Albrecht was influential in developing the trade with Sweden and Norway, and his sons Wolf Moldenhauer and Burghard Moldenhauer established themselves in Bergen and Stockholm, becoming leaders of the local Hanseatic activities."
 flavor_hsa.22.a: "His mercantile expertise is astonishing."
 flavor_hsa.23.t: "Grevens Fejde"
 flavor_hsa.23.d: "The situation in Denmark, given the recent disastrous developments, is dire. The court of their feeble monarch is torn asunder as petty nobles fight over the royal authority, as well as the right to exercise it. Recently, we have been approached by foreign agents purporting to be messengers of the rebelling factions in the court of Denmark. They suggest that a monetary donation of a certain magnitude would assist them in their endeavours against their tyrannical overlord. Whatever the case may be, this could be our chance to mingle in Danish politics and weaken their crown authority!"

 flavor_hsa.24.t: "The New Staple Port in Amsterdam"
 flavor_hsa.24.d: "Many factors certainly have contributed to the downfall of the Hanseatic League during the first half of the 15th century. Be it disease, misfortune, divine retribution or the Bullion Famine, our court lost its old splendor and its standing as a powerful mercantile union of hundreds of merchants across the germanic cities and beyond. In its stead, the scheming merchants of the Dutch court attempt to usurp our position and surpass us in terms of influence across the markets of Europe. Such behavior is no less the grounds for just wars and these petty men of Holland must be put in their place lest we risk inevitable demise."
 flavor_hsa.24.a: "We will have their heads for this!"
 flavor_hsa.25.t: "Hans Holbein the Younger"
 flavor_hsa.25.d: "Hans Holbein (the Younger) was a German painter and printmaker who worked in a Northern Renaissance style, and is considered one of the greatest portraitists of the 16th century. He also produced religious art, satire, and Reformation propaganda, and he made a significant contribution to the history of book design. He is called \"the Younger\" to distinguish him from his father Hans Holbein the Elder, an accomplished painter of the Late Gothic school. \n\nHolbein was born in Augsburg, but he worked mainly in Basel as a young artist. At first, he painted murals and religious works, designed stained glass windows, and printed books. He also painted an occasional portrait, making his international mark with portraits of humanist Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam. When the Reformation reached Basel, Holbein worked for reformist clients while continuing to serve traditional religious patrons. His Late Gothic style was enriched by artistic trends in Italy, France, and the Netherlands, as well as by Renaissance humanism. The result was a combined aesthetic uniquely his own. \n\nHolbein travelled to England in 1526 in search of work, with a recommendation from Erasmus. He was welcomed into the humanist circle of Thomas More, where he quickly built a high reputation. He returned to Basel for four years, then resumed his career in England in 1532 under the patronage of Anne Boleyn and Thomas Cromwell. By 1535, he was King's Painter to Henry VIII of England. In this role, he produced portraits and festive decorations, as well as designs for jewellery, plate, and other precious objects. His portraits of the royal family and nobles are a record of the court in the years when Henry was asserting his supremacy over the Church of England. \nHolbein's art was prized from early in his career. French poet and reformer Nicholas Bourbon (the elder) dubbed him \"the Apelles of our time,\" a typical accolade at the time. Holbein has also been described as a great \"one-off\" of art history, since he founded no school. Some of his work was lost after his death, but much was collected, and he was recognised among the great portrait masters by the 19th century. Recent exhibitions have also highlighted his versatility. He created designs ranging from intricate jewellery to monumental frescoes. \n\nHolbein's art has sometimes been called realist, since he drew and painted with a rare precision. His portraits were renowned in their time for their likeness, and it is through his eyes that many famous figures of his day are pictured today, such as Erasmus and More. He was never content with outward appearance, however; he embedded layers of symbolism, allusion, and paradox in his art, to the lasting fascination of scholars. In the view of art historian Ellis Waterhouse, his portraiture \"remains unsurpassed for sureness and economy of statement, penetration into character, and a combined richness and purity of style\"."

 flavor_hsa.26.d: "Many proclaimed our Republic to be on its dying breath as the second half of the 15th century saw our merchants struggling to maintain (and often losing) their monopoly across the many trade centers of Europe. Despite several setbacks and the machinations of our enemies, we have managed to not only come out on top but to also reinforce the values of our Trade League.
