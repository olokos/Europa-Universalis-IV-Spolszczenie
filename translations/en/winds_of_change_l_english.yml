 feo_black_sea_fleet_title: "Black Sea Fleet"
 feo_black_sea_fleet_desc: "The Black Sea has been a hotspot of mercantile competition ever since the arrival of the Italians in the Crimean shores. Our Principality has seen a slow decline in maritime actions, being pushed around by the Ottomans, Italians, Hordes, as well as fellow Greeks. Creating a new fleet to combat these problems will be quite beneficial."
 feo_black_sea_domination_title: "Black Sea Domination"
 feo_black_sea_domination_desc: "Trade has always been the main source of revenue for the Greeks. Trade, which Gothia has seen a decline of since the grip of the Komnenos dynasty loosened, and the Italian Yoke emerged. Reclaiming our position in the Black Sea will put a stop to this decline."
 feo_komnenos_relations_title: "Ties With the Komnenos"
 feo_komnenos_relations_desc: "The Komnenos in Trebizond were our old allies decades ago. They were the rulers of Gothia, yet our merchant family was able to slowly emerge as a player in the Black Sea politics. Now that their realm is in decline, it is perhaps time the roles are reversed."
 feo_constantinople_title: "A Merchant's Family Home"
 feo_constantinople_desc: "Constantinople, the city where many Emperors ruled before us. The old center of culture, wealth, and prestige for any Greek, and the city where many families like ours emerged from. It is time we return once more, and hold a triumph in the streets to let them know that we have vanquished our foes."
 feo_balkan_conquest_title: "Basileus of the Balkans"
 feo_balkan_conquest_desc: "The Balkans were one of the more important regions of the old Byzantine Empire. Whilst it is a mountainous area, some of its wealth cannot be underestimated. Let us prepare a campaign to reclaim this lost Byzantine land."
 feo_rival_genoa_title: "Genoese Relations"
 feo_rival_genoa_desc: "The arrival of the Genoese forever shook our position in Gothia. Many foreign merchants have been buying land off us, and have reduced our coastal influence to but a single port. Maybe it is time we try and combat this threat, either with the sword or with the pen."
 feo_break_italian_control_title: "Dealing With the Italians"
 feo_break_italian_control_desc: "Gothia's coastal influence has been in tatters for far too long. If we are to ever stand a chance at reclaiming our status in the Black Sea, the Italians must be pacified, or destroyed."
 feo_gothia_title: "Gothia Ascendant"
 feo_gothia_desc: "The Hordes and the Italians have been dealt with. Our principality which started from the city of Mangup is now more than just that. We can finally start the next step of our nation's ambitions: Restoring Gothia."
 feo_gothia_ascendant_pp: "Gothia Ascendant"
 feo_aegean_supremacy_title: "Aegean Supremacy"
 feo_aegean_supremacy_desc: "What are merchants but selfish chancers? And what would selfish chancers in the Aegean want other than complete control? Securing the Aegean Islands, or fortifying its coast will allow us to reign supreme against our rivals and enemies that may reside there."
 feo_azov_sea_title: "Question of Azov"
 feo_azov_sea_desc: "The province of Azov in Crimea is one of the most vital ports in the Black Sea. Developed by the Italians as their main haven for conducting trade, it is a threat to our Black Sea domination plans. Perhaps then, it is time for some merchant-to-merchant conversation...."
 feo_conflits_in_lithuania_title: "Plains of Ruthenia"
 feo_conflits_in_lithuania_desc: "Our conquest of the Steppes has brought us many foreign riders, perhaps way too many for us to manage. By conquering Ruthenia, we may perhaps have the opportunity to settle some of them there."
 feo_gavras_triumphant_title: "Gavras Triumphant"
 feo_gavras_triumphant_desc: "We were but a humble merchant family years ago. Now, we sit atop a throne made of gold, triumphant over our Greek rivals. The rest of the world shall soon know of this accomplishment."
 feo_gothic_invasion_title: "Gothic Invasion"
 feo_gothic_invasion_desc: "Gothia may have returned, but the Gothic ways have not. Germany has yet to be conquered. The kings and Queens there have yet to bend their knees to us. Then, we shall make them knee using the sword."
 feo_crimea_title: "Crimean Oppressors"
 feo_crimea_desc: "The Crimean people have been a thorn in our side for many decades. Always raiding our border, and sometimes sponsoring invaders like Tamerlane to raze our land. Blood and ash shall be the only tribute they receive."
 feo_beyond_crimea_title: "Into the Steppes"
 feo_beyond_crimea_desc: "Our Crimean campaign was a major success, as we have dealt with two birds using one stone. Now, it is time we push even deeper into Steppe territory, using our now seasoned warriors to bring us victory."
 feo_integrate_cossacks_title: "$MONARCHTITLE$'s Vanguard"
 feo_integrate_cossacks_desc: "The Tatars may have been an enemy once, but one cannot deny their prowess in battle. Instead of eliminating them, perhaps we can use them in our society or in our ranks."
 feo_caucasia_title: "Gateway to the Middle East"
 feo_caucasia_desc: "Caucasia is a mountainous area, perfect for us to use against anyone that may invade us from the Middle East. We shall make sure that our soldiers secure these mountainous passes."
 feo_russian_aristocracy_title: "A Russian Aristocracy"
 feo_russian_aristocracy_desc: "We may be of Greek origin, but much of our aristocracy has major connections to the families in Russia. It may be best if we use these connections to secure new allies, but it may also be worthwhile to use them in order to claim the land for ourselves."

 feo_steppe_development_title: "Settling the Goths"
 feo_steppe_development_desc: "The Steppes are filled with foreigners, which are unreliable for bringing profit to our realm. Settling some of our people there to create cities would help fix that problem."
 feo_russian_aid_title: "Russian Aid"
 feo_russian_aid_desc: "Our newfound allies in the North have been of great help so far. However, our local manpower has always been scarce and our officers unreliable. Perhaps by asking them to send some officers to help us, we can knock out one of these problems."
 feo_russian_guard_title: "Guards of the [Root.GovernmentName]"
 feo_russian_guard_desc: "The Gothic people are limited, and we have so far relied on foreign recruits, who are not as disciplined as those of our Russian brothers. Requesting them to send a small guard of elites would help with this problem."
 feo_russian_claims_title: "Our Russian Claim"
 feo_russian_claims_desc: "With our connections in Russia solidified, we are now able to press our claim to the throne. Although our aristocracy may help us with that, we still need to placate the people..."

 flavor_feo.2.d: "There have been many Emperors before us. Some led glorious lives, reclaiming territories once held by Rome, whilst some were the reason for its downfall. With us now standing inside the Hagia Sophia, it is time we make a decision. Shall we carry on this Roman legacy, or shall we perhaps choose a different path?"

 flavor_feo.6.d: "Years of intermixing with the Tatar people has led to many of our officers wanting to integrate them within our ranks, part of our cavalry force, as they are some of the most formidable riders we have ever met. Whilst they may be correct, that would also lead to many of them abandoning their lives in the Steppes, not contributing to the nation by administrating their lands."

Shall we maintain our status as rulers of [Root.GetName], or shall we rule as a dual monarchy?"

 hsn2_righteousness_of_the_faith_desc: "Our great ancestor, Salah ad-Din, elevated our family to greatness through his utter unwillingness to compromise with the righteousness of his faith. He threw down the Fatimid Caliphs and their Shia state, and he defeated the Christian crusaders in the levant.\nOur time is once again one of religious turmoil with Shiism on the rise. We must take up the mantle of the great conqueror and be a force for the righteous in the Middle East."

 hsn2_strenghten_central_authority: "Strengthen Central Authority"
 hsn2_strenghten_central_authority_desc: "It was once the way of our family to divide the spoils of our success among our kin. However, this policy also weakened the sultanate in many ways, planting seeds of discord in our midst. This time we will instead take after other imperial administrations of this region, and create a strong central authority to oversee all land grants."
 hsn2_state_economics: "State Economics"
 hsn2_state_economics_desc: "Our ancestors realized that for an empire to prosper its rulers must be able to keep the peace and guarantee its subjects protection. Some parts of the economy are then best left to the private citizens, while others could be beneficially controlled by our ministers. Trade, industry, and commerce will allow our empire to blossom."

 hsn_move_capital_to_damascus_desc: "Damascus once served as the Ayyubid capital and the seat of Saladin. Let us return our court to this glorious city and restore it to its former glory."
 flavor_hsn.1.t: "The Ayyubid Restoration"
 flavor_hsn.1.d: "The Ayyubid Empire once stretched far and wide and stood as the lion of Islam and the custodian of the Holiest Cities. Saladin's successors, unable to honor his legacy, have weakened the Sultanate, and the unfortunate turn of events led to its collapse. We have been stagnating ever since, however, our recent campaigns of conquest prove that the eagle's wings have not been broken yet. With our hearts set on restoring the glory of our ancestors, we march forward, for we are the bloodline of Saladin, and his legacy is ours to reclaim!"
 flavor_hsn.1.a: "The Eagle Takes Flight Once Again!"
 flavor_hsn.2.t: "Fate of the Mamluks"
 flavor_hsn.2.d: "Egypt, once the heartland of our Empire, has for centuries been controlled by the Mamluks, who had once been our most loyal soldiers, then turning into traitors who caused the downfall of our Sultanate. As we have managed to reclaim much of our rightful lands, we now face the difficult question: how shall we address the Mamluks? Is it possible to forgive them for their betrayal so that they may once again serve our dynasty, or shall we dismantle them once for all and rely only on our regular armies?"
 flavor_hsn.2.a: "We must seek reconciliation"
 flavor_hsn.2.b: "We can no longer trust them!"
 flavor_hsn.3.t: "The Title of Khalifa"
 flavor_hsn.3.d: "Centuries ago, the great Salah ad-Din switched Egypt's allegiance to the Abbasids, which resulted in a major shift, since previously, Egypt had been dominated by the Shiite Fatimids. Since his ascension to power, our rulers have upheld the authority of the Abbasid Caliphs, granting them respect and allegiance as the spiritual leaders of Islam. Since our resurgence, we have grown to become a significant force in the Islamic world; gaining military prowess, skillful governance, and admiration of loyalty of the masses. As our Sultanate stretches far and wide, controlling the most important cities of Islam, the temptation to assert our own claims to the Caliphate grows. Although many advise us to uphold the Abbasid authority, many others believe that claiming the Caliphate will lead to the path of unparalleled greatness. The decision must be made."
 flavor_hsn.3.a: "We shall respect the Abbasid authority!"
 flavor_hsn.3.b: "We will claim the mantle of Muhammad for ourselves!"
 flavor_hsn.5.t: "Legacy of Saladin"
 flavor_hsn.5.d: "The tales of Saladin's military genius echo through the ages. His tactical prowess on the battlefield and his diplomatic acumen during the Third Crusade have left an indelible mark on the world. As the Sultan of Egypt and Syria, Saladin established the Ayyubid dynasty and led it to great victories, including the recapture of Al-Quds from the hands of the Crusaders, ending nearly nine decades of occupation by the Franks. As our dynasty aims to restore the greatness that once was, the legacy of Saladin beckons us. How shall we honor his heritage?"
 flavor_hsn.5.a: "Our advisors must study his tactics"
 flavor_hsn.5.b: "His legacy shall guide our finest generals"
 flavor_hsn.5.c: "Saladin's wisdom will inspire our rulers"
 flavor_hsn.5.de: "We need his spirit to lead us now!"
 flavor_hsn.6.t: "Restoring the Mausoleum of Saladin"
 flavor_hsn.6.d: "When the great Salah ad-Din passed away, his earthly remains were placed into the newly built Mausoleum that was constructed adjacent to the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus. Over the centuries, the place has deteriorated and is anything but a worthy resting place for such an important person. It should be in our best interest to renovate this tomb."
 flavor_hsn.6.a: "Inshallah, we will restore it"
 flavor_hsn.6.b: "We need resources elsewhere"
 flavor_hsn.7.t: "Solidifying Egypt"
 flavor_hsn.7.d: "Before its fall to the Mamluks, the region of Egypt had been the heart of our empire. It was here where Saladin seized power from the Fatimids and founded our glorious dynasty, so the region's importance for our dynasty cannot be overlooked. As we now control Egypt's most important cities, some are suggesting that we should consider moving our capital to Egypt in order to further solidify our rule over the region. After all, [361.GetName] had already served as our capital for decades. What shall we do?"
 flavor_hsn.7.a: "Let us return the seat to [361.GetName]"

 flavor_ita.1.t: "Claiming Roman Ancestry"
 flavor_ita.1.d: "Though times have changed, there are many voices calling for a return to the past. Our reunited country is only now growing to be a great power. However, as the direct heirs of the Romans, we could try to claim their mantle and pursue the empire's restoration. Such a blatant act of imperialist desire will serve us no good on the international stage though."
 flavor_ita.1.a: "We are the true heirs of Rome!"
 flavor_ita.1.b: "Take a more tacit approach."
 flavor_ita.2.t: "Economic Policy Going Forward"
 flavor_ita.2.d: "Our country is comprised of many provinces inherited from the states we have gobbled up during the unification process. Each of them had their own set of economists and fiscal ideals. Yet, the most common policies are the good old mercantilism and the rather popular idea of economic liberalism employed by Camillo Benso, count of Cavour."
 flavor_ita.2.a: "Employ Cavour!"
 flavor_ita.2.b: "Mercantilism is tried and tested."
 flavor_ita.3.t: "The Galley-Galleon Hybrid"
 flavor_ita.3.d: "The galleass is a feat of naval engineering developed for the needs of the Mediterranean Merchant Republics, especially Venice. A combination of the galley and the galleon, those ships are created for naval combat. But they too, could be adapted for our more contemporary needs. Let us convene and decide their future."
 flavor_ita.3.a: "We need them to serve as transports!"
 flavor_ita.3.b: "Our navy will need far more than that."
 flavor_ita.3.c: "They are not sturdy enough."
 flavor_ita.4.t: "Military Governorship Evolves"
 flavor_ita.4.d: "As we take on great powers and seize vast amounts of territory, we have begun experimenting with the old strategy of granting newly converted territories to the administration of our generals. This could help motivate our military men and lighten the administrative burden."
 flavor_ita.4.a: "Generals should focus on ruling with an iron fist."
 flavor_ita.4.b: "Grant them more executive powers."
 flavor_ita.4.c: "We need the generals on the fields!"
 flavor_ita.5.t: "Eternal Rome"
 flavor_ita.5.d: "Many have claimed this title and tried to do what others could not, but none have succeeded. The Roman Empire has to many been nothing more than a faint goal they could strive forward, but never reach. However, we have proven it doesn't have to be this way. Having seized the initiative, we have, through blood and toil, brought this empire back together and we shall pride ourselves with it for the rest of eternity, for Rome is undefeated."
 flavor_ita.5.a: "Glory be to Rome!"
 flavor_ita.6.t: "The Italian Military"
 flavor_ita.6.d: "Italy used to be split up among dozens of princes, each with their own retinue and military. Yet, if there was one unifying factor, it would be the presence of the Condottieri contractors - mercenaries the rich Italian cities would employ to do their bidding. We could base our current defense on such or adopt more modern military techniques."
 flavor_ita.6.a: "Adapt the Condottieri!"
 flavor_ita.6.b: "Focus on the fire."
 flavor_ita.7.t: "Call to Arms!"
 flavor_ita.7.d: "Word has reached us, that war has been declared upon the most noble Emperor in an attempt to destroy the empire. As the most honorable electors and maintainers of ancient customs, it is in our vested interest to join the imperial cause and prevent the calamity from happening. This war is already looking to be one of the most seminal events of this century."
 flavor_ita.7.a: "We must defend the empire!"
 flavor_ita.7.b: "It's a trap! A ploy to dismantle the empire!"
 flavor_ita.9.t: "The Italian Wine"
 flavor_ita.9.d: "Our tight grip on the production of the finest wine has put us in a unique position. We are fully able to exploit the market's desire for our wine and we will do precisely that. Such action is bound to impact the prices of Wine worldwide."
 flavor_ita.9.a: "Taste it once, taste it forever."
 flavor_ita.10.t: "The Spice Route"
 flavor_ita.10.d: "The declining trade routes from the East Indies to Venice have been revitalized. Should you embark on a merchant ship in Aceh or Malacca, it is more than likely your end destination will be Venice arriving through the Suez Canal."
 flavor_ita.10.a: "All the spices belong to us!"
 flavor_ita.11.t: "Beyond the Pillars of Hercules"
 flavor_ita.11.d: "It has been decades since the discovery of America by the Italian Navigator Cristoforo Colombo. The continent, revealed to be rich with empty land ripe for the taking, has become the center of attention for the rulers of France, Britain, and Iberia. Since then, many of those monarchs have attempted to claim American territories in order to funnel the wealth to their ports. It is high time we followed in their stead or taken action to reroute their ships to our ports."
 flavor_ita.11.a: "Let us found settlements in empty land!"
 flavor_ita.11.b: "Claim foreign colonies."
 flavor_ita.12.t: "Italian New World"
 flavor_ita.12.d: "The new world has been discovered by Cristoforo Colombo. Though it may have been claimed for others, it was a discovery made by an Italian and it was the precursor to our now complete domination of the New World. Nowadays, we are one of the major powers ruling the American continents."

Renowned for his adept handling of color and groundbreaking brushwork techniques, Tiziano's artistic journey spans over seven decades. Throughout this extensive period, he crafts an extensive array of works encompassing portraits, mythological narratives, and religious compositions. Notable among his portraits, such as 'Portrait of Charles V' and 'Venus of Urbino,' is the acclaim they receive for their profound psychological depth and opulent color schemes. Tiziano's impact on the evolution of both Venetian and European art is deep-seated, and his enduring legacy positions him as one of the foremost painters of the Renaissance."

 flavor_ven.41.d: "During the Renaissance in Venice, art and architecture reached new heights of sophistication and splendor. Venetian art, characterized by luminous color and emotional depth, was exemplified by the works of renowned painters like Tiziano, Tintoretto, and Veronese. These artists excelled in capturing the essence of their subjects through vibrant palettes and striking chiaroscuro techniques, which lent their creations an unparalleled sense of realism. Portraiture was a central theme, with artists achieving remarkable character portrayals. Additionally, allegorical and mythological subjects became popular, showcasing Venetian art's diverse range and emotional resonance.\n\nIn the realm of architecture, Venice's unique position as a trade hub between East and West left an indelible mark on its Renaissance structures. Venetian Gothic architecture combined intricate tracery and pointed arches with Byzantine and Oriental influences. This fusion is strikingly evident in iconic structures like the Doge's Palace and St. Mark's Basilica. As the Renaissance progressed, the Palladian style, championed by architect Andrea Palladio, introduced classical symmetry, columns, and pediments into the city's architectural vocabulary. Venetian palazzos along the picturesque canals, adorned with ornate facades and courtyards, became emblematic of the city's opulence. Together, Venetian art and architecture during the Renaissance reflect the city's unique cultural synthesis and continue to captivate enthusiasts worldwide."

This celebration is a symbol of Venice's wealth and decadence during this period."
 flavor_ven.42.a: "A celebration for the ages!"
 flavor_ven.43.t: "The Carnival in Venice"
 flavor_ven.43.d: "The history of the Venice Carnival dates back to the 11th century when it began as a celebration of the Venetian Republic's victory over its enemies. Over time, the Carnival evolved into a grand and unique event, gaining popularity in the 15th century. During this period, Venice's status as a major trading hub in Europe allowed it to accumulate considerable wealth. This prosperity fueled the extravagance of the Carnival. It became a symbol of Venice's opulence and decadence, attracting visitors from all over Europe who were eager to participate in the masked festivities. The masks worn during the Carnival not only provided anonymity but also served as a way to erase social distinctions, allowing people from different backgrounds to mingle freely during the celebrations.\n\nIn the 18th century, the Venice Carnival reached its zenith, characterized by elaborate costumes, theatrical performances, and intricate mask designs. However, in 1797, the Carnival was banned by the occupying French forces, and it remained dormant for nearly two centuries. It wasn't until the late 20th century that the Carnival was revived, becoming the internationally renowned event it is today. Today's Venice Carnival preserves the traditions of the past, featuring stunning masks and costumes, street performances, and a vibrant atmosphere, making it a captivating and nostalgic journey into the city's rich history and culture."

 flavor_ven.44.t: "The Power of the Doge"
 flavor_ven.44.d: "Francesco Foscari's leadership as Doge of Venice from 1423 to 1457 was a period of both accomplishments and challenges. His rule oversaw Venice's territorial expansion in Italy and the eastern Mediterranean, enhancing its maritime and trade influence. However, it was also marked by internal conflicts and growing discord among the city's elite. Foscari's persistent pursuit of war against the Republic of Milan strained Venice's resources, while the influential Council of Ten encroached on his authority, leading to the banishment of his own son for corruption. In 1457, Foscari resigned and died in exile, a poignant episode that inspired literary and artistic works, most notably Lord Byron's play The Two Foscari.\n\nThe authority of Venice's Doges underwent a significant transformation through the centuries. In the early days of the Venetian Republic, these leaders wielded substantial political and military power. However, by the 15th century, their role had shifted to become more symbolic and ceremonial, as the influential Council of Ten, responsible for state security matters, increasingly constrained the Doge's decision-making. The Doge's duties centered on representing Venice in formal settings, receiving foreign envoys, and presiding over ceremonies. Actual political influence lay dispersed among various councils, noble families, and institutions like the Great Council, embodying Venice's distinctive system of governance characterized by checks and balances, ensuring that no single figure, even the Doge, could exercise absolute authority and thereby fostering stability and averting authoritarian rule."

Originally conceived as a fortress-like edifice, the palace evolved over time into a magnificent representation of Venetian Gothic architecture. This architectural marvel served the dual purpose of being both the residence of the Doge, the preeminent political leader of the Venetian Republic and housing various government offices and courts.\n\nBy the 16th century, the Doge's Palace had undergone substantial renovations and expansions, resulting in a significant augmentation of its grandeur. One of the most remarkable developments was the completion of its iconic façade, which faced the Grand Canal, showcasing the palace's architectural splendor to all who approached by water. This period of renovation and expansion further solidified the palace's status as an enduring symbol of Venetian power and authority. Its halls and chambers, characterized by intricate designs and opulent decorations, not only bore witness to centuries of political activities but also stood as an enduring testament to the city's rich history and continued significance on the global stage."

 flavor_ven.46.d: "During the 15th and 16th centuries, theater in Venice was a vibrant and influential cultural phenomenon. The city was home to some of the earliest permanent theaters in Europe, such as the Teatro di San Cassiano, which opened in 1637, and the Teatro Olimpico, designed by Andrea Palladio in 1580. These venues hosted a wide range of theatrical performances, including plays, operas, and comedies, attracting both locals and tourists. Venice's unique position as a major maritime and trading hub allowed for the exchange of artistic ideas and influences from across Europe, contributing to the development of Venetian theater as a rich and diverse form of entertainment that played a pivotal role in the history of European drama and performance arts."

Figures like Girolamo Brusoni and Ferrante Pallavicino, among others, are associated with this covert group, marked by its use of subterfuges like paradox and allegory to avoid criticism. Operating discreetly, members often employ secret language and publish anonymously, with their philosophy influenced by Trajano Boccalini, embracing Aristotelian naturalism from the University of Padua.\n This clandestine academy, despite facing censorship and finding its works on the Index, boldly challenges societal norms through satirical compositions and hybrid genres. Shaped by the ideologies of Machiavelli, Paolo Sarpi, and others, they critique tyranny in historical writings. Surprisingly, the Accademia degli Incogniti becomes a key force in advancing musical theatre in Venice, establishing the Teatro Novissimo."

They also imposed constraints on the Doge's powers, such as prohibiting direct correspondence with foreign leaders and interference in the election of the Patriarch of Venice. Over time, the promissione became increasingly comprehensive and was eventually printed, with documents for different Doges growing in length, ranging from 108 to 301 pages. To prevent the office from becoming hereditary, restrictions extended to the Doge's relatives, barring them from certain councils and positions. Although some restrictions were eased in the later years of the Venetian Republic, significant limitations remained in place, even for the Doge's family members. The oaths also included provisions regarding the Dogaressa, including her attire and ceremonial duties."

He is generally considered one of the greatest visual artists in the history of art and the most important in [Root.GetAdjective] art history. Unlike most [Root.GetAdjective] masters of the 17th century, Rembrandt's works depict a wide range of styles and subject matter, from portraits and self-portraits to landscapes, genre scenes, allegorical and historical scenes, and biblical and mythological themes as well as animal studies. His contributions to art come in a period of great wealth and cultural achievement that we have eloquently dubbed the [Root.GetAdjective] Golden Age, when [Root.GetAdjective] art (especially [Root.GetAdjective] painting), although in many ways antithetical to the Baroque style that dominated Europe, has become extremely prolific and innovative and is giving rise to important new genres."

Beginning his military career under János Hunyadi, his battlefield prowess and loyalty to King Mátáys distinguished him in the Hungarian army. He played a significant role in numerous battles across Hungary, Bohemia, and the Balkans. The Black Army greatly benefits from his exceptional leadership, and now it is time we award this hero of Hungary for his years of service by offering him a well-deserved position and recognition."
 flavor_hun.39.a: "Offer him a position at the court"
 flavor_hun.39.b: "He must lead our armies"
 flavor_hun.39.c: "His service is needed elsewhere"
 flavor_hun.40.t: "Gubec's Peasant Uprising"
 flavor_hun.40.d: "In the late 16th century, the nobles of the western Balkans were continuously increasing the taxes and suppressing the rights of the local peasants. As feudal lords often opted for cruel and violent punishments of those who refused to pay the taxes, the situation became unbearable and it was just a question of time before a rebellion broke out. In Croatia, this harsh treatment by local barons and land disputes led to civil unrest, often resulting in armed conflicts. With the complaints of the oppressed unanswered, the rumors are spreading that the peasants of Croatia have united under the leadership of Matija Gubec, and are planning an open rebellion against our authority. We must act swiftly and resolve this situation."
 flavor_hun.40.a: "The nobles went too far. The peasants must be compensated."
 flavor_hun.40.b: "The nobles were right"
 flavor_hun.41.t: "Fate of the Empire"
 flavor_hun.41.d: "The fall of the Habsburgs has sent shockwaves tearing through the Holy Roman Empire as the Imperial princes reel in horror. Without their imperial dynasty, the Empire is at the weakest it has ever been, and this gives us the unique opportunity to decide its fate. Shall we fill the void left by the Habsburgs and ascend the throne as the next imperial dynasty, or shall we seal the empire's fate by dismantling it once and for all?"
 flavor_hun.41.a: "The imperial crown shall be ours!"
 flavor_hun.41.b: "We shall become the empire's bane"
 flavor_hun.42.t: "Adam Frantisek Kollár"
 flavor_hun.42.d: "Adam František Kollár was a jurist, Imperial-Royal Court Councillor and Chief Imperial-Royal Librarian, a historian, and an influential advocate of the enlightened policies of Austrian emperors. His extensive research included the development of ethnology as a scientific discipline, and he was one of the first pioneers of pan-Slavic activism within the Austrian Empire. It is a shame that such an influential person who was born in Hungary is serving the interests of a foreign power. Perhaps, we should consider offering him a high position at our court, so that he may serve his homeland instead of protecting foreign interests."
 flavor_hun.42.a: "Offer him a position at our court"
 flavor_hun.42.b: "He is needed elsewhere"
 flavor_hun.43.t: "Pál Kinizsi"
 flavor_hun.43.d: "Pál Kinizsi is a legendary figure of our armies, having for decades served our court. This veteran has fought numerous battles and won many victories against the Turks and others, and thanks to his exceptional military skills, he never lost a battle in his entire career. For decades, he was the sole person responsible for the defense of vast territories stretching from Slavonia to Transylvania and has occupied various administrative positions as well. As his military career is slowly coming to an end, our kingdom has the opportunity to utilize his expertise elsewhere. How should we make use of his skills?"
 flavor_hun.43.a: "He could teach our generals a lot"
 flavor_hun.43.b: "The court could make use of this experience"
 flavor_hun.43.c: "He deserves to rest for his service"
 flavor_hun.44.t: "Beatrice of Aragon"
 flavor_hun.44.d: "Beatrice of Aragon, also known as Beatrice of Naples, was a significant figure in the Italian Renaissance, renowned for her patronage of the arts and influence on cultural and political affairs. Born into the House of Trastámara in 1457, Beatrice was the daughter of Ferdinand I of Naples and Isabella of Clermont. Her upbringing in the vibrant cultural milieu of Naples instilled in her a deep appreciation for the arts and humanities. Beatrice's marriage to Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary, in 1476 cemented her role as a key diplomatic figure in Renaissance Europe. Through her patronage, she fostered a thriving cultural exchange between Italy and Hungary, facilitating the transfer of artistic ideas, manuscripts, and scholars. In Hungary, Beatrice established a renowned court library, the Bibliotheca Corviniana, which became a center for humanist learning and scholarship. Her patronage supported the work of prominent humanist writers and scholars, contributing to the intellectual flourishing of the Renaissance. Beyond her cultural endeavors, Beatrice played a crucial role in diplomatic affairs, acting as an intermediary between Italian city-states and Hungarian interests. Her diplomatic acumen and political influence helped strengthen ties between Naples, Hungary, and other European powers. Perhaps, our court could make use of her skills."
 flavor_hun.44.a: "Her work is invaluable"
 flavor_hun.44.b: "She should not meddle in the state affairs"
 flavor_hun.45.t: "Tripartitum"
 flavor_hun.45.d: "The Tripartitum, also known as Opus Tripartitum, was a significant legal work compiled in the Kingdom of Hungary during the Renaissance. Created in the late 15th century, it served as a comprehensive legal code, covering the law of both nobility and commoners. It aimed to consolidate and codify Hungarian law, drawing from previously established customary law. Its compilation was a monumental undertaking, reflecting the king's commitment to legal reform and governance. Despite its influence, the Tripartitum never gained official country-wide recognition. Should we codify it?"
 flavor_hun.45.a: "Codify it!"
 flavor_hun.45.b: "There is no need for such a code"
 flavor_hun.46.t: "Transylvanian Saxons convert to Protestantism"
 flavor_hun.46.d: "Johannes Honterus, a pivotal figure in the religious and intellectual landscape of Transylvania during the 16th century, played a significant role in the spread of Protestantism among the Saxon population. Born in Transylvania, Honterus was a scholar, humanist, and clergyman deeply influenced by the ideas of the Protestant Reformation. Educated in Germany and imbued with the spirit of Reform, he returned to Transylvania with a fervent dedication to spreading the principles of Protestantism. Under Honterus's influence, the Saxons of Transylvania began to embrace Protestant teachings, particularly Lutheranism. His eloquent preaching, scholarly writings, and tireless advocacy for Reform resonated with many within the Saxon community, leading to a gradual but significant shift away from traditional Catholicism. The conversion of the Saxons to Protestantism under Honterus's leadership had profound implications for the religious and cultural identity of Transylvania. His influence has grown so much that except for some minor areas that remain staunchly Catholic, almost all Saxon-inhabited regions of Transylvania have now embraced Protestantism."
 flavor_hun.46.a: "So be it"
 flavor_hun.46.b: "We must root out this heresy!"
 flavor_hun.47.t: "Bibliotheca Corviniana"
 flavor_hun.47.d: "Commissioned by Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary from 1458 to 1490, this magnificent library was among the most renowned centers of learning in Europe during the late 15th century. Matthias Corvinus, known for his patronage of the arts and sciences, assembled a remarkable collection of manuscripts and printed works spanning various disciplines, including philosophy, theology, history, medicine, mathematics, and literature. The Bibliotheca Corviniana housed over 2,000 volumes, making it one of the largest libraries of its time. The significance of the Bibliotheca Corviniana extended beyond its impressive contents. It served as a hub for scholarly exchange and played a pivotal role in the dissemination of knowledge throughout Europe. Scholars from across the continent were drawn to the library, contributing to the intellectual vibrancy of the Renaissance. It serves as a symbol of the Renaissance's intellectual fervor and the power of patronage in cultivating knowledge and innovation, and serves as a reminder of the enduring value of preserving and cherishing our cultural heritage."
 flavor_hun.47.a: "Knowledge is power"
 flavor_hun.48.t: "Capital in Danger"
 flavor_hun.48.d: "With the recent Ottoman expansion, our capital of [153.GetName] finds itself in a very vulnerable position. Even though [153.GetName] is well fortified, the surrounding terrain provides no advantage to the defenders if the city were ever besieged by the Turks. Many are suggesting that it would be wiser to move the court to a different city, one further away from the border with the Ottomans. The upper Hungarian town of [1772.GetName] seems to be the best candidate. What should we do?"
 flavor_hun.48.a: "We could never abandon [153.GetName]!"
 flavor_hun.48.b: "It is wiser to move the court to [1772.GetName]"
 flavor_hun.49.t: "Juraj Jánosík"
 flavor_hun.49.d: "The infamous bandit Juraj Jánosík and his group have been terrorizing the nobles and burghers of Upper Hungary. Their audacious raids have caused a great deal of distress and disruption, and it seems to be nearly impossible to track him and his group down since they share a portion of their loot with local peasants who then in turn protect them from the authorities. He is slowly becoming a hero of the local Slovak folk, and his group is rapidly growing in size, as many, even from Poland and Moravia, are joining his ranks. The estates, unable to handle the situation on their own, have come to us with complaints and pleas for aid. They are requesting the Crown's intervention to track down Jánosík and bring him to justice."
 flavor_hun.49.a: "Organize a group to hunt him down"
 flavor_hun.49.b: "Hungarian estates cannot deal with one bandit?"
 flavor_hun.50.t: "Jánosík Strikes Again"
 flavor_hun.50.d: "Ignoring the pleas of the Estates has led to dire consequences - Juraj Jánosík and his band have struck again, this time with even more audacity and ferocity. The estates are enraged and the people live in fear. The crown can no longer turn a blind eye to Jánosík's terror."
 flavor_hun.50.a: "Mobilize the troops!"
 flavor_hun.51.t: "The End of Jánosík"
 flavor_hun.51.d: "Thanks to our efforts, the infamous bandit Juraj Jánosík and most of his group have finally been caught and brought to justice. Following a trial in Liptószentmiklós, Jánosík was sentenced to death. Although we have failed to catch some other members of his group, it is safe to assume that without Jánosík's leadership, the bandits will disintegrate and cease their actions. The estates are finally relieved, and peace has been restored in Upper Hungary."

 flavor_hun.53.d: "Our new investments in the development of [153.GetName] have paid off, as the city continues to gain wealth and size, we now have the ability to look towards the future. Even now many question if we should use our newfound production capabilities to focus on producing different kinds of trade goods in our capital. Perhaps we should look to producing goods that will stand a better chance of generating profit in the future. Many have been suggesting to focus on the processing of raw material imported from the mines of Upper Hungary and Transylvania, while others wish to establish new manufactories for the production of cloth or glass, that would rival even the famed Bohemian and Venetian works. What shall we do?"

Third was Tlaloc, whose grief, sorrow and anger destroyed the earth on which the humans lived in. The Fourth was Chalchiuhtlicue, whose humanity was tricked by Tezcatlipoca to hate their Sun. The Fifth was Huitzilopochtli, God of War, and the current sun of humanity. In his constant battle to keep humanity alive, we must offer humans sacrifices to nourish him, as well as keep Tezcatlipoca at bay, and offer blood for the great Quetzalcoatl."

 flavor_azt.19.d: "In Lake Texcoco, home to our Empire, one man on his throne had a dream. He saw something outside of this cage that we live in. He saw a land, a limitless land that he sought to conquer. The man's name is Moctezuma I, the second Emperor of the Aztec Empire. Although in the past the title of Emperor was only ceremonial, he transformed it into a proper title through the subjugation of his neighbors, as well as military crackdown of the other members of the alliance.\n\nWith this recent shift in power, he can now start chasing his dream. There are many threats around him, such as the Purepecha Empire, the Tlaxcalan Senate, the remnants of the Zapotec, and even the disunited Mayan lands. There are many foes that threaten to stop this dream, but we shall conquer even Mictlan for him."

 flavor_azt.20.d: "The fires of the Flowers Wars have burned brightly, leaving many soldiers and citizens dead. Many dead means much blood spilled for the Gods, yet costly victories may lead to setbacks for our dream of Aztlan. With the fall of Tlaxcala, our greatest rival in Mexico has fallen. [Root.Monarch.GetName] is now the sole ruler of the cities around Lake Texcoco.\n\nWith this newfound peace in our lands, the banners are slowly being raised again. In the past, we ended the conflict in Central Mexico. Now, we are preparing to divide and conquer the lands of the Zapotec."

 flavor_azt.21.d: "Conquest is never enough to subdue a populace. The military crackdown will only temporarily keep the spirit of the defeated low. In order to properly govern, to properly rule, you must first divide them. Make them feel alone, and isolated, split them apart, then rule them.\n\n [Root.Monarch.GetName] has followed this strategy against the Zapotec, the cloud people. As they were already divided, all that was left was to deal the final blow, and the remnants of their civilization are now under our rule."
 flavor_azt.21.a: "We have divided them. Now it is time we rule them."

Yet they do not know the full extent that you must go in order to collect blood. Mere sacrifices will not do. Battles must be costly, tactics must be brutal, all in the name of victory. Conflict, as the God Tezcatlipoca promotes, is the source of blood.\n\nAll of this is not enough. [Root.Monarch.GetName] knows that even in victory, we must celebrate with more blood. For that reason, we will hold a great sacrifice in the land of the Mayans."

[Root.Monarch.GetName] had a dream though, to become the sole ruler of Mesoamerica, and recreate Aztlan.\n\nHe set out to conquer the cities around Tenochtitlan, and establish himself as the first true Emperor of the Aztecs. He led a plethora of new reforms as he ended his conflicts with the Tlaxcala alliance. As he split the clouds in half, he created an administration to rule over the numerous city-states in Mexico. With his conquests of the Mayan people, he strengthened the religious character all around the realm, increasing the amount of blood offered to the Gods. Now, all that is left is to once again sit upon his throne, as a legend that brought light and unity in this land plagued by conflict and darkness."

In this age, [Root.GetName] has seen its first spark.\n\nMaximilian I of [Root.GetName] is perhaps the most renowned Holy Roman Emperor.

Taxing the vast riches of Hindustan is not only a problem of having the military power or authority to do so.

 MUG_berar_desc: "The Malwa plateau is a good base of operations for expansion into Southern India and the vast region between us and the Tamil Country known as Deccan. This region is in many ways quite different from what we are used to. Many have desired the fabled diamonds of Golconda or the rich trading cities of the Coromandel Coast, but in order to get there we must scale mountains, and jungles, defeat the native kingdoms, and ultimately be ready to rule what the Delhi sultans never could.\n\nIt is time we crossed the Vindhyas."

 MUG_fatehpur_sikri_desc: "Our realm is one of many faiths and has been so since its very conception. Relying on the loyalty of just our co-religionists has therefore always been out of the question. We must instead promote religious discussion and debate so that any differences can be settled in a more peaceful manner.\n\nLet us build a new capital, near the great city of Agra, a wonder of Mughal architecture to display the full glory of our dynasty, but also designed to hold the many faiths of our empire. A specifically created house of worship for religious debates between Jains, Hindus, Christians, Zoroastrians, and any other faith within our borders will allow us to fully explore the spiritual world."

 MUG_malwa_title: "Conquer Malwa"
 MUG_malwa_desc: "With the fall of the fortresses in western Rajputana the rich Malwa plateau now lies open before us. The conquest of this region would both enlarge the Imperial treasury and open for future campaigns against Gujarat and the Deccan states.\n\nIt is our fortune that the Malwa Sultans have been weak and allowed local interest groups too much free rein. This has left the area divided and easy to integrate for a more efficient state such as ours."
 MUG_maidan_title: "Control the Desh"

 MUG_western_allies_title: "Western Allies"

 MUG_bengal_title: "Bengal Entrepot"
 MUG_bengal_desc: "The Ganges Delta has been a focal point for trade and commerce for thousands of years. Here eastern traders market their wares to the Indian public, while goods from all over northern India can flow in the other direction.\n\nThe recent arrival of western traders has, if anything, further accentuated this dynamic, and trade cities have begun to spring up all over the delta. We must further encourage this development and foster the growth of a major entrepot here in Bengal under our supervision."
 MUG_orissa_title: "Conquest of Orissa"
 MUG_orissa_desc: "Nestled between the Garjats and the Bay of Bengal the eastern coastline of Orissa is perhaps not as rich or wealthy as Coromandel further south.

 MUG_coromandel_desc: "The Coromandel Coast now lies before us. It has been a major center for Indian trade for hundreds if not thousands of years. Here foreigners from east and west established trade posts and factories, bringing great amounts of the silver our economy needs. The expensive textiles, spices, gemstones, pearls, and manufactured goods that they seek to bring to their homelands are also easy to find in this region which is home to great Tamil and Telugu cities with a strong heritage of industry and trade."

 MUG_afghan_frontier_title: "Afghan Frontier"
 MUG_afghan_frontier_desc: "Kabulistan and Sistan have long been the staging areas for those that would invade India. The region is both close to the vital passes for entering the subcontinent and home to a number of clans that have specialized in raiding and looting the Punjabi plain.\n\nWe must subdue this region once and for all, and place strong garrisons here to protect against foreign invaders."
 MUG_abu_saids_dream_title: "Abu Said's Dream"

Abu Said came closer to realizing the re-unification of that empire but eventually, he fell into what our ancestors call the great disaster of Iraq-Ajemi.\n\nLet us pick up this fallen mantle and reach further than those that came before us. We are the Gurkani, heirs to the great conquerors and fearful of no living men."
 MUG_tripura_title: "Follow the Brahmaputra"
 MUG_tripura_desc: "From its sources in distant Ngari the Brahmaputra river flows through all of Tibet, Arunachal and then descends into India in Assam before joining the Ganges in Bengal.

 MUG_china_title: "Open China"
 MUG_china_desc: "Our recent expansion has put us at the border of the Empire of China. The Middle Kingdom was always a distant giant. A country of as much wealth and population as the entire Indian subcontinent put together but where India was often fractured, China was stable and centralized.\n\nThe Chinese seem unwilling to engage with us on our terms, but we must not let them dictate rules for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of the mighty Mughal Empire.
