Muslim merchants now make deeper inroads into the countryside of our and traveling Sufis have become a more common sight among our settlements. At times it is possible to track the path of such holy men by the converts they leave behind as they move from one area to the next. Some of these men are already famous when they come to our lands and possess a way to mobilize the heart and will of men to follow a ruler they see as just.\nOne particularly famous Sufi teacher has recently arrived in our lands."

He says that he is willing to settle in our lands for a while and act his old profession, dispensing justice according to the Sharia, ensuring law and order in our lands. This would no doubt be popular, especially among the Muslim community in our country. His experience in other countries might also help centralize our realm."

[Root.Monarch.GetName] has [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] shown great interest in the foreign religion but still practices many of the rituals of our ancestors. Perhaps it is because [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] takes such interest in them that the Muslim community itself has come to scrutinize the life and actions of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. The Muslim community leaders question whether [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] decisions are really made with the best interests of them and their god in mind."

 tengri_events.14.a: "Great!"

 tengri_events.15.d: "With the increasing influence of Islam, especially in our growing cities, the older legal codes such as the Yassa have increasingly come to be abandoned in favor of the Sharia that our Muslim urban dwellers prefer.\nThis development has recently resulted in a heated legal battle in [Root.GetName] where an important warrior from a local clan is insisting on his rights according to tradition while the urban establishment is insisting on following the Sharia. Supporting one side over the other will undoubtedly have repercussions for the development of the entire area."

 tengri_events.15.b: "Appoint someone to judge according to our traditions."
 tengri_events.16.t: "Popular Sufi Teacher"
 tengri_events.16.d: "A teacher of a lineage of famous Sufis has recently gained increasing popularity in our lands. His teachings have not only won the ears of our Muslim communities but also have deeply impressed the more traditional warrior elites. Many that listen to his words will still not forsake the Tengri Shamans but the teacher's charismatic personality ensures that even so they will value every word of this 'Khoja'. A local noble that managed to come into conflict with the Khoja lost so badly he had to abandon his lands.\nSo far the Khoja have been quietly supporting our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], perhaps he could be persuaded to support the throne a bit more openly if we grant him land and an official title at our court?"

 tengri_events.17.d: "The power of the Khoja lineage over our subjects is almost too great. They are constantly meddling in legal cases, religious policy and the day-to-day business of our country. The Khoja is, however, still one of the most valiant supporters of the throne. With the crowning of [Root.Monarch.GetName] we will be expected to affirm the ties to the Khoja and perhaps extend his privileges even further."
 tengri_events.17.a: "He remains our strongest supporter."
 tengri_events.17.a.tt: "This will strengthen the Khoja and increase the likeliness of him or his successors attempting to take power in the future."
 tengri_events.17.b: "Attempt to limit the influence of the Khojas."
 tengri_events.17.b.tt: "This will weaken the influence of the Khojas and their chances to take power in the future."
 tengri_events.18.t: "The Khoja takes power"
 tengri_events.18.d: "Not content to continue to serve as the power behind the throne the current head of the Khoja lineage has today declared himself to be more fit to rule than any [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. His followers are massing on the outskirts of our capital as well as in the countryside attempting to create a state built directly upon the teachings of their charismatic Sufi teacher."

 tengri_events.19.t: "Shiite Diaspora"
 tengri_events.19.d: "While there is ample doubt about the sincerity of our conviction word of our conversion has spread among the Shiite communities around the world. Small groups of Shiites have begun to arrive in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] seeking to help build and protect a state for those that honor the Imams.\nTheir services might come in quite handy but our Shamans are apprehensive about allowing what they see as foreign zealots to settle among our people."

 tengri_events.21.d: "In their desire to spread their faith and incorporate the [Root.GetName] realm into the wider Buddhist world some monks have taken it upon themselves to translate many Buddhist historical, philosophical and religious works for the benefit of our people. These manuscripts have opened the eyes of many to a new spiritual world as well as given us a better understanding of the surrounding world in general. Among the nobility collecting these manuscripts has become fashionable, though some would say not always for spiritual reasons."
 tengri_events.21.a: "Welcome the dissemination of these books."
 tengri_events.21.b: "We must honor our ancient traditions instead."
 tengri_events.22.t: "Shaman Defeated in [Root.GetName]"
 tengri_events.22.d: "Strange tales are reaching us from the provinces of a traveling Buddhist Monk using his wisdom to overcome various problems and spreading his faith among the many people benefiting from his help. Not everyone is happy with these advances among the common people, however, as they often involve defeating the local Shamans.\nIn [Root.GetName] this monk reportedly defeated a local Shaman and cured a local princess from a severe malady, leaving the traditional rituals appearing poor and insufficient. As a result the local lord has banned traditional rituals in his lands and is instead promoting [Root.SecondaryReligion.GetName]."

 tengri_events.23.d: "For some time Vajrayana monks have been gaining followers in the province of [Root.GetName] and while their influence is still quite limited they have apparently taken it upon themselves to go one step further in their missionary activity. Reports are reaching [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] of the destruction and incineration of our ancestral idols. The general reception of this policy has not turned out as the monks would have hoped, however, as the locals are now defending themselves from both the monks and the central authority that favors them."
 tengri_events.23.a: "Ok."
 tengri_events.24.t: "Religious Pilgrimages"
 tengri_events.24.d: "It has become customary among our nobles to travel to the holy places of Vajrayana Buddhism in Tibet and India to study and learn of the Buddhist faith. As they return bringing new customs and perspectives to our country our society is slowly changing. This is not always a process without problems but recently we have been seeing some very positive trends in our government as a result of this exchange."
 tengri_events.24.a: "Great!"
 tengri_events.25.t: "Land Theft"
 tengri_events.25.d: "With the increasing influence of the [Root.SecondaryReligion.GetName] faith in our country a number of new monasteries have been founded in our country. Their purpose is both to harbor the [Root.SecondaryReligion.GetName] monks that have come to our lands and the slowly growing number of native [Root.GetAdjective] monks.\nTraditional landholders don't seem to be very impressed by the pretensions of these newcomers, however, and have been helping themselves to the lands reserved for the monks. The monks claim that the land would be made more productive under their control while the land holders feel they are demanding the right to what is already theirs."
 tengri_events.25.a: "We must support these orders!"
 tengri_events.25.b: "We must protect the traditional rights of our people."
 tengri_events.26.t: "Pali Legal Traditions"
 tengri_events.26.d: "With Theravada Buddhism comes an ancient legal tradition based on old Pali scriptures as well as the collected rulings of many judges and monarchs before up to this day. Some Theravada monks have found our lack of collected written rulings very disturbing and have sought our blessings to create a collection of up-to-date rulings that, together with the Pali Canon, could serve as a basis for future rulings in our country."
 tengri_events.26.a: "Allow the scholars to continue."
 tengri_events.26.b: "The Yassa is enough for us."
 tengri_events.27.t: "Pure Land Buddhism"
 tengri_events.27.d: "By adopting the Mahayana faith we have opened our borders to a wide range of traditions and teachings but none seem to have attracted as many followers as the promises of the 'Pure Land' movement has. Throughout [Root.GetName] subjects immersed in meditation and recitation have become an increasingly common sight."
 tengri_events.27.a: "Amitabhaya."
 tengri_events.30.t: "Spread of Confucian Ideals"
 tengri_events.30.d: "Impressed by the refined and well-argued tenets of Confucianism many of our nobles have begun to strive to improve themselves through rigorous study and hard work. As a result we are not only becoming better at understanding the wider Confucian world but the administration of our land and resources has notably improved and above all become more consistent."
 tengri_events.30.a: "Recruit these men as administrators."
 tengri_events.30.b: "We can use this to purge corruption."
 tengri_events.30.c: "Let us encourage them to develop the land itself."
 tengri_events.31.t: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the Beiles"
 tengri_events.31.d: "As the learned ideals of Confucian philosophy gain more and more ground among the [Root.GetAdjective] nobility [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been beset by fears that our old ways are being forgotten. Many high ranking [Root.GetAdjective] dignitaries have taken to using foreign titles and names rather than the [Root.Culture.GetName] titles of our ancestors. Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] worries that in a generation none will remember the old ways of the bow and horse and our nation will be one of weak scribes and poets."
 tengri_events.31.a: "No nation that has abandoned its own language can prosper!"
 tengri_events.31.b: "We have no reason to fear the Confucian Way."
 tengri_events.32.t: "Confucian Elites Alienated"
 tengri_events.32.d: "Participation in many traditional rituals is reserved for our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and those closest to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. While this means the Confucian elite of our country cannot take part this has not often been a problem as they view such 'superstitious' rituals and sacrifices with at best mild displeasure. This insistence to keep our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and his closest from the old [Root.Religion.GetName] elites separate from our other subjects has, however, led to an unnecessarily sharp divide between the two groups. This, rather than the rituals themselves, seems to be a constant source of irritation and misunderstandings, even at the very top of our society."
 tengri_events.32.a: "Praise the heavens!"
 tengri_events.32.b: "Let us device common rituals instead."
 tengri_events.33.t: "[Root.Heir.GetName]"
 tengri_events.33.d: "Those around [Root.Heir.GetName] agree that the child is showing promise beyond what was initially expected. [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] is learning quickly and [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] skills are improving by the day.\nTraditionally the heirs of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] should spend their young years learning how to ride and shoot as the [Root.Culture.GetName] warriors of our past. This might not be the best way to take care of the growing abilities of [Root.Heir.GetName] however. Given the opportunity Confucian teachers promise to teach our heir how to better [Root.Heir.GetHerselfHimself] and more importantly how to rule and make the most of our land and its subjects."
 tengri_events.33.a: "Let us hire Confucian teachers."
 tengri_events.33.b: "A traditional education is the only way."
 tengri_events.33.c: "We have no extra resources to spare for [Root.Heir.GetHerHim]."
 tengri_events.35.t: "Spread of the Tea Ceremony"
 tengri_events.35.d: "The elaborate Tea Ceremonies that are common in many Shinto lands have spread far further than the Shinto religion itself and are becoming commonplace in most [Root.GetAdjective] cities as well as among the members of our court."
 tengri_events.34.t: "Examination of Administrators"
 tengri_events.34.d: "The Chinese have long felt that a good way to ensure efficient administration according to Confucian ideals is to hold general examinations for all administrators. This works well for a country with generations of experience to draw upon, something we do not have.\nThe current lack of both administrators and teachers might be remedied by attracting some of those that have failed the examinations in neighboring countries but we would be paying a high price for an uncertain commodity."
 tengri_events.34.a: "It is a risk we must take."
 tengri_events.34.b: "Let us seek talent among our own instead."
 tengri_events.35.a: "Our courtly culture will never be the same."
 tengri_events.35.b: "Encourage the spread of the Way of Tea."
 tengri_events.36.t: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] Loses Face"
 tengri_events.36.d: "The Shinto view of failure is somewhat different from that of our Tengri traditions. As Shinto values become an increasingly important part of our society the expectations on our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] change.\nSome actions of [Root.Monarch.GetName] have come to be interpreted as lacking in both honor and ability by those who follow the syncretic mix of Shinto and Tengri customs that has come to take shape in our lands."
 tengri_events.36.a: "This is unfortunate."
 tengri_events.36.b: "The Shamans say I cannot be faulted."
 tengri_events.37.t: "Japanese Swordsmithing"
 tengri_events.37.d: "Opening up our realm to Shinto customs and culture have also resulted in an increasing migration of Shinto practitioners into our lands, among them a number of Japanese weaponsmiths. The Swords they produce have become increasingly popular with the richer parts of our society and Japanese smiths are becoming common in most of our cities. Many of our elite warriors have begun to train with these weapons.\nSome worry that this will mean the abandonment of the Martial traditions of our ancestors though even those that cling to the old ways have benefited from a greater understanding of foreign fighting techniques."
 tengri_events.37.a: "Encourage our elites to use these swords."
 tengri_events.37.b: "Bow and arrow is for the true Tengri warrior."
 tengri_events.38.t: "Growth of Monasteries"
 tengri_events.38.d: "Used to acting far away from the Patriarch of their church the Coptic Monastic Orders have quickly made themselves at home in our lands. They are now growing in numbers and influence, especially in the frontier regions under our control. Under ideal circumstances the orders stand ready to move into a newly conquered region, establishing new monasteries, quickly stabilizing and converting the region to their faith. Our Shamans are alarmed at this practice as they feel they should be the ones to welcome our new subjects rather than these foreign Monks."
 tengri_events.38.a: "Excellent!"
 tengri_events.38.b: "We must promote our Tengri Shamans!"
 tengri_events.39.t: "Papal Embassy"
 tengri_events.39.d: "An official Papal embassy has arrived in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] seeking audience with [Root.Monarch.GetName]. The task of the envoys is to judge the sincerity of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], to once again hear him accept the pope as the head of the church and to include [Root.Monarch.GetName] into the wider Catholic community.\nIn order to achieve this the envoys have brought with them a number of books, maps and learned men. Surely these men are also spies, eager to learn our secrets. It is also certain that our Shamans will disagree with any policy of bowing to a foreign head of religion and refusing them an audience would please them. But perhaps the knowledge these Catholics bring can make up for missing that opportunity."
 tengri_events.39.a: "Send these spies back home!"
 tengri_events.39.b: "We are loyal followers of the Roman Church."
 tengri_events.40.t: "Christian Missionaries"
 tengri_events.40.d: "A group of Christian missionaries from abroad has arrived in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] and are eager to spread the word of God among the heathens. Not wanting to come into conflict with our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], however, they come seeking our blessing. The leader of the group has approached the throne asking to be given the right to spread the Christian faith in a region under our control unhindered."
 tengri_events.40.a: "Let them go wherever they please."
 tengri_events.40.b: "Send them back where they came from."
 tengri_events.40.a.tt: "This province may come to change Religion in the future."
 tengri_events.40.c: "Prohibit them from converting Tengriists."
 tengri_events.41.t: "Spread of Christianity"
 tengri_events.41.d: "The missionaries in [Root.GetName] have made good progress towards converting the local population there. Shamans have become an increasingly rare sight and a number of churches dot the landscape."
 tengri_events.41.a: "Praise the Lord."
 tengri_events.42.t: "Conflicts between Shamans and Missionaries"
 tengri_events.42.d: "The presence of a mission in [Root.GetName] has led to a number of conflicts between the [Root.Religion.GetName] Shamans and the local Priests. Shamans have proclaimed curses over the priests and sometimes on entire congregations."
 tengri_events.42.a: "It is time for the missionaries to leave."
 tengri_events.42.b: "We must not interfere."
 tengri_events.43.t: "Christian Ruler Alarmed"
 tengri_events.43.d: "The adoption of Christianity beside the traditional [Root.Religion.GetName] faith of our ancestors has given rise to a number of less than orthodox customs. Syncretic rituals that reference both the god of Christianity and the gods of the sky have become commonplace and some have even been adopted at the court of [Root.Monarch.GetName].\nWhile this seems to please most of our Christian subjects the delicate sensibilities of a Christian subject ruler visiting [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] have been deeply upset by his forced participation in such rituals."
 tengri_events.43.a: "But they're both lords of heaven?"
 tengri_events.43.b: "Try to make amends."
 tengri_events.44.t: "Miracle"
 tengri_events.44.d: "Word has reached us of a remarkable wanderer. Drawing his power from his strong devotion to the Christian god he has managed to heal the weak and cure the sick. An increasing number of converts have begun to create congregations in his trail. Many still incorporate parts of their old Tengri customs in their daily life but this holy man has been more successful in attracting followers than many of the more traditional missionaries that now frequent our countryside."
 tengri_events.44.a: "Let him roam freely."
 tengri_events.44.b: "Invite him to Court."
 tengri_events.45.t: "Life at Court"
 tengri_events.45.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has always taken a great interest in both our adopted religion and those that practice it. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] has, however, not always led a life that many of our Christian subjects would approve of. Between the influence of Shamans at court and the habits of [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] there are many that feel we are risking divine punishment.\nPerhaps we should consider instituting some more clearly Christian rules for our court and ruler? Restricting the influence of Shamans, the number of allowed wives and generally the number of officially sanctioned rituals would go a long way towards placating the Christian communities."
 tengri_events.45.a: "A Christian court it is!"
 tengri_events.45.b: "Theses religions must coexist, side by side."
 tengri_events.45.b.tt: "Every province following our §YSyncretic§! faith will get §R6§! unrest for §Y10§! years."
 tengri_events.46.t: "Brahmans and Shamans"
 tengri_events.46.d: "A battle of the minds and spirits of our people has ensued between Brahmin priests and Shamans, who consider themselves guides and protectors of our people. Lately heated discussions frequently end with Shamans cursing the Brahmins while the Brahmins turn to us, insisting that their hereditary status be respected."
 tengri_events.46.a: "Support the Brahmin Administrators."
 tengri_events.46.b: "Support our Shamans."
 tengri_events.46.c: "Avoid picking sides."
 tengri_events.47.t: "Syncretism"
 tengri_events.47.d: "The coexistence of Hinduism and the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith has been easier in many ways than we initially feared. There are already many examples of Tengri deities being incorporated among the many gods of the Hindus and of Hindu gods and customs being incorporated into the lives of the Tengri worshippers. In fact to a certain extent it seems that the same has started happening to many other religions in the far corners of our empire, with many lesser and higher gods being incorporated into the joint Hindu-Tengri Pantheon."
 tengri_events.47.a: "Great!"
 tengri_events.48.t: "Spread of the Caste System"
 tengri_events.48.d: "With the elevation of the Hindu faith a great number of Hindus have come to settle in many of our cities and with them the concept of caste is spreading into our lands. Interestingly it seems at least some of those that regularly do business with the Hindus as well as some of our Shamans have taken to this way to organize society.\nThe immediate effects seem hard to judge but for now everything seems to progress a bit more smoothly in [Root.GetName]."
 tengri_events.48.a: "Ok."
 tengri_events.49.t: "A Jewish Homeland?"
 tengri_events.49.d: "Word of our adoption of the Jewish religion has started to spread far and wide among the Jews of the Diaspora. A slow but increasingly steady trickle of immigrants have begun to appear at our borders, hoping to live and serve in a state where they are not confined to Ghettos or restricted by laws and prejudice."
 tengri_events.49.a: "Let them serve as administrators!"
 tengri_events.49.b: "Let them serve as soldiers!"
 tengri_events.50.t: "Growing Zoroastrian Merchant Community"
 tengri_events.50.d: "While the Fire temples of [Root.GetName] probably seem a bit unorthodox to them our society is still attracting a number of Zoroastrians in the diaspora. Ever since they left Persia behind almost a millennium ago they have grown used to being the minority and seem content to mix with our society at large. Some, however, have come asking for an area of their own where they can live and worship in their traditional ways."
 tengri_events.50.a: "'Like sugar in milk.'"
 tengri_events.50.b: "Best to keep them all in one place."
 tengri_events.51.t: "Growing Pantheon"
 tengri_events.51.d: "Fusing our Shamanic traditions with the wide range of animist beliefs we have come across have resulted in an ever-growing Pantheon. There is not a malady, disaster or fate that hasn't got at least one deity to counteract it. This wide acceptance of differing spiritual traditions has led to an increasingly efficient handling of the religious conflicts between the subjects under our control, no matter what they believe."
 tengri_events.51.a: "Great."
 tengri_events.52.t: "Support of the Shamans"
 tengri_events.52.d: "Court Shamans have always been an important institution in our state. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] nobles participate in a wide range of ceremonies to ensure the gods looking favorable on our endeavors, be it going to war or sealing a strategic marriage. With the greatly increased numbers of Shamanic traditions we now patronize we can be sure of their support, a point not lost on our subjects."
 tengri_events.52.a: "The Gods favor our wars."
 tengri_events.52.b: "The Gods will bless our people."
 tengri_events.53.t: "Flower Wars"
 tengri_events.53.d: "Inspired by Nahuatl forerunners our warriors have begun to raid foreign lands already subjugated by our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to take prisoners to be offered at the Sacrificial Stone to the heavens. This is slightly problematic as these are people who have agreed to obey us in exchange for protection but the experience these warriors get in close combat could be useful to us."
 tengri_events.53.a: "Extradite the offending warriors."
 tengri_events.53.b: "The gods crave their blood!"
 tengri_events.54.t: "Sumptuary Restrictions?"
 tengri_events.54.d: "Taking offense to the luxurious clothes of a merchant in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] a number of warriors have taken it upon themselves to storm his lavish home and rob him of his belongings. They claim such finery must be reserved for those that have distinguished themselves in battle and that they have rectified an offense to the gods. The merchant on the other hand is furious and demand retribution and for his property to be returned."
 tengri_events.54.a: "Side with the merchant."
 tengri_events.54.b: "Side with the warriors."
 tengri_events.55.t: "Confiscation of Idols"
 tengri_events.55.d: "The people of [Root.GetName] have been organizing their resistance against our rule through the local holy places and many of their leaders are to be found in the local clergy. Assimilation will surely quieten them in the long run but for now our Inti priests suggest that we confiscate their [Root.Religion.GetName] idols, by protecting them in our capital we can ensure that the people of [Root.GetName] remember where the real power lies."
 tengri_events.55.a: "An excellent idea."
 tengri_events.55.b: "Barbaric."
 tengri_events.56.t: "Ritual Ball Game"
 tengri_events.56.d: "Our Mayan priests are eager to promote the ritual ball games of their religion, a custom to which many of our warriors have been quite receptive. Many now flock to the courts to see their favorite teams compete though perhaps the associated betting is as much of an attraction as their religious conviction."
 tengri_events.56.a: "For the Gods!"
 tengri_events.56.b: "For the People!"
 tengri_events.57.t: "New Bible Translation"
 tengri_events.57.d: "Eager for all our subjects to be able to read and interpret the word of God themselves the Protestant priests of our country are seeking our support for creating a new Bible translation. They claim the new translation will bring our people together as never before and introduce them to the one god they worship."
 tengri_events.57.a: "Great!"
 tengri_events.58.t: "Predestination"
 tengri_events.58.d: "The idea that 'All events whatsoever are governed by the secret counsel of God' is held dearly among the members of the Reformed church in our country. So much so that it has come to spread beyond to those that wouldn't be considered Christians by any definition. Whether it is due to this or not lately many of our subjects seem unusually eager to outdo themselves. Be it in areas of governance or economy."
 tengri_events.58.a: "Gold is a measure of quality."
 tengri_events.58.b: "Loyalty proves character."
 tengri_events.59.t: "Monastery Established"
 tengri_events.59.d: "Some way back a number of our most pious Orthodox monks left the areas under our control in order to create a fortified frontier monastery in the wilder parts of the lands we border. The story of their success has attracted a number of believers to join them. Their settlement is now growing and will soon be noteworthy. Perhaps now would be a good time to claim the land for ourselves so that these settlers don't forget where they came from?"
 tengri_events.59.a: "It is time we claim those lands for ourselves."
 tengri_events.59.b: "They are on their own."
 tengri_events.60.t: "Arrival of a Rich Merchant"
 tengri_events.60.d: "Eager to make a good profit of the various goods available in our lands merchants from the wider Muslim world continue to seek out our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. One such man is now claiming that we are not doing enough to capitalize on the resources under our control. For a modest fee he is offering to act as our agent in all contacts with foreign merchants in general and the influential finance groups such as the Karimis in particular."
 tengri_events.60.a: "Interesting."
 tengri_events.61.t: "Sickness of [Root.Heir.GetName]"
 tengri_events.61.d: "A strange disease has struck [Root.Heir.GetName], a fever that our Shamans have been unable to stop or even alleviate. A visiting Sunni physician claims to recognize the condition and to be able to cure it. Our Shamans would likely take offense if we brought in an outsider after their own widely known failure but the life of our heir seems to be at its end unless we do something."
 tengri_events.61.a: "Let the Physician try."
 tengri_events.61.b: "There is nothing we can do."
 tengri_events.62.t: "Protection of Pilgrims"
 tengri_events.62.d: "Our frequent wars have made the faithful Muslims of our state reluctant to undertake pilgrimages to the holy cities. While faith may frequently overcome fear it is true that pilgrims passing through our lands are often attacked and their journey is often a perilous ordeal."
 tengri_events.62.a: "We must ensure their safety."
 tengri_events.62.b: "Their faith will protect them."
 tengri_events.63.t: "Influence of the Khojas"
 tengri_events.63.d: "While [Root.Monarch.GetName] has limited the influence of the Khojas compared to some of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] predecessors they remain a powerful force in our lands and many of our subjects look up to the Khoja and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] family. This powerful faction in our country has never outright confronted us but their ever-present influence is slowly eroding our authority."
 tengri_events.63.a: "There is nothing to be done right now."
 tengri_events.63.b: "Attempt to limit the influence of the Khojas."

 desc_nobility_sumptuary_restrictions: "We have implemented a series of harsh restrictions on who can and cannot buy certain luxury items.

 desc_held_back_commoners: "We have acted to protect the established classes against the ambition of the rising class of 'New Men' who aim to replace them in many higher positions of power within the state, from the army to the administrative apparatus or even the court rooms.

 cossack_estate_events.1.t: "Colonization of the Steppes"
 cossack_estate_events.1.d: "The $ESTATE_NOBLES$ complain that an increasing number of serfs are deserting the safe homes provided to them to seek their fortune among the Cossacks of the Steppes. They feel we are to blame as we have allowed the Cossacks to grow too powerful which is inspiring the serfs to abandon their rightful masters.\nRepresentatives of the major families now demand that we limit the power of the Cossacks so that they can expand their latifundia in the regions bordering the steppe. This way, they argue, the wild fields can be tamed and the laws of the realm upheld."
 cossack_estate_events.1.a: "These Serfs must be brought back."
 cossack_estate_events.1.b: "We cannot afford to anger the Cossacks."
 cossack_estate_events.2.t: "Cossack Aggression"
 cossack_estate_events.2.d: "Moving quickly by boat or on horseback, the Cossacks of the steppes are very adept raiders. Several such raids have lately laid waste to our countryside and even major cities some way from our borders. Once the raids have been executed these plunderers retreat back behind the borders of [cossacks_here_target.GetName] as quickly as they came. Both the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ and our $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ have interests in the affected areas and both groups now demand that we do something."

Several such raids have lately laid waste to our countryside and even major cities some way from our borders. Once the raids have been executed these plunderers retreat back behind the borders of [cossacks_here_target.GetName] as quickly as they came. Our local authorities in the affected areas are now demanding that we do something."
 cossack_estate_events.2.a: "Demand that these Cossacks be brought to Justice!"
 cossack_estate_events.2.b: "We will just have to let this slide."
 cossack_estate_events.3.t: "Cossack Aggression"
 cossack_estate_events.3.d: "Moving quickly by boat or on horseback the Cossacks of the steppes are very adept raiders. Several such raids have lately laid waste to the [From.GetAdjective] countryside and even major cities some way from our borders.\nAs the Cossacks responsible are based inside our borders the [From.GetAdjective] have now demanded both compensation and for the culprits to be brought to justice."
 cossack_estate_events.3.a: "This matter is beyond our control."
 cossack_estate_events.3.b: "Bring them to justice!"
 cossack_estate_events.4.t: "The [From.GetAdjective] Response"
 cossack_estate_events.4.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] response is that they refuse to take responsibility for the raids into our country, claiming that they are unable to control the Cossacks themselves."
 cossack_estate_events.4.a: "We care little for such excuses."
 cossack_estate_events.5.t: "The [From.GetAdjective] Response"
 cossack_estate_events.5.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] response has been to send some monetary compensation for the raids of their Cossack subjects which has made up for the damage to property. They also claim that they have brought the guilty parties to justice."
 cossack_estate_events.5.a: "If we could only believe that."
 cossack_estate_events.6.t: "Growth of Cossacks Power"
 cossack_estate_events.6.d: "While few would dispute their influence on the Steppes the Cossacks have many things working against them when it comes to gaining influence in the halls of power. The $ESTATE_NOBLES$ despise them and would see them all brought to work as serfs on their latifundia and their manners have not brought them many friends in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName].\nLately, however, things have been going their way. They have managed to defend their settlements and their services to the state as raiders are indisputable."
 cossack_estate_events.6.a: "Ok."
 cossack_estate_events.7.t: "Decline of Cossacks Power"
 cossack_estate_events.7.d: "The free nature of the Cossacks and the distance between them and the halls of power in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] has always been a problem for them. Lacking hereditary privileges the number of Cossacks registered with the state as officers with the benefits that entail have been decreasing steadily."
 cossack_estate_events.7.a: "Ok."
 cossack_estate_events.8.t: "Petition for Privileges"
 cossack_estate_events.8.d: "Not all Cossacks are awarded the same privileges by the state. Traditionally rights are awarded to specific Cossacks that are willing to perform great services to the state in times of war. As these rights are not transferable upon death this means that the influence of the Cossacks can vary greatly over time. According to the Cossacks it is high time we grant them further privileges to bolster our numbers."
 cossack_estate_events.8.a: "We need more registered Cossacks!"
 cossack_estate_events.8.b: "Let them tend to their Steppes."
 cossack_estate_events.9.t: "Supplies for the Cossacks"
 cossack_estate_events.9.d: "Life on the frontier can be harsh and while the Cossacks are used to fighting their own battles a little help from the central treasury could probably be put to good use. Last season was unusually harsh and together with an increasing number of Tatar incursions many Cossacks now have an urgent shortage of food for the coming months. If we were to supply the Cossacks with grain as well as military supplies such as arms and uniforms we would not only be strengthening our defenders on the Steppes directly we would likely also tie them closer to our state."
 cossack_estate_events.9.a: "Send them what they need."
 cossack_estate_events.9.b: "They'll have to make do themselves."
 cossack_estate_events.10.t: "Grain Trade Disturbances"
 cossack_estate_events.10.d: "There has always been tension between the Cossacks and the other estates, if nothing else because of their uncommon manners and diverse backgrounds. Lately, however, these have increased considerably. The $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ are alarmed at the Cossacks raids and claim that they are targeting shipments of their grain. The Cossacks themselves claim that they are only attacking the Tartars and brigands in the area and that the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ are simply mistaken. As there is little in the way of government representation in the area it is difficult to ascertain the truth but there is clearly friction between these two groups and we are expected to either reprimand or sanction one side in this conflict."
 cossack_estate_events.10.a: "Support the Cossacks."
 cossack_estate_events.10.b: "Support the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$."
 cossack_estate_events.11.t: "Cossack Settlers in [cossack_settlers_province.GetName]"
 cossack_estate_events.11.d: "The life of the Steppes has made the Cossacks used to a frontier living. Constant threats from both a harsh climate in an unsettled land and of Tartar raiders have made the Cossacks both feared warriors and hardy settlers.\nAs we turn our sights on the land of [cossack_settlers_province.GetName] it is becoming apparent that life on the eastern frontier is not that different from that of the Steppes we already control."
 cossack_estate_events.11.a: "Enlist Cossacks Settlers."
 cossack_estate_events.11.b: "We cannot trust the Cossacks."
 cossack_estate_events.12.t: "Unrest among the Cossacks"
 cossack_estate_events.12.d: "The deep distrust of the Cossacks for the state in general and our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] in particular has culminated in a total breakdown of authority on the steppes. The communities of the Cossacks are openly hostile to our emissaries and de facto now act entirely independent from central authority."
 cossack_estate_events.12.a: "Leave them alone, relations will improve in due time."
 cossack_estate_events.12.b: "Crush the dissenters."
 cossack_estate_events.13.t: "Cossack Expansion in [growing_cossack_communities.GetName]"
 cossack_estate_events.13.d: "Borders can often be theoretical things, especially in the wild fields. It seems the Cossacks have expanded rapidly into [growing_cossack_communities.GetName]. We could attempt to reverse this development but the Cossacks would likely not take kindly to being removed from land they have worked hard to settle."
 cossack_estate_events.13.a: "Accept the new Status Quo."
 cossack_estate_events.13.b: "Reclaim the land from the Cossacks."
 cossack_estate_events.14.t: "Demands for Extended Privileges"
 cossack_estate_events.14.d: "The old dream of the Cossacks has always been to be accepted as the equals to the established estates such as the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ or $ESTATE_BURGHERS$. Never has this dream been closer to realization than now. The Cossacks have achieved great influence in our state and in many ways we rely on their support.\nGiven the favorable circumstances many Cossacks are now voicing their old demands for official recognition and privileges."
 cossack_estate_events.14.a: "Preposterous."
 cossack_estate_events.14.b: "Give in to their demands."
 cossack_estate_events.15.t: "[Root.GetName] Cossacks Revolt"
 cossack_estate_events.15.d: "Unimpressed by our decree to vacate [Root.GetName] the Cossack host there has risen in revolt."
 cossack_estate_events.15.a: "Ok."
 cossack_estate_events.16.t: "Wavering Loyalty of the Cossacks"
 cossack_estate_events.16.d: "Good relations need to be maintained. As their numbers grow and some of the leaders of the Cossacks grow older our warm relations have grown colder. We need to make arrangements with the current breed of Cossacks leaders in order to be sure of their loyalty."
 cossack_estate_events.16.a: "Ok."
 tribal_estate_events.1.t: "Tensions between Nomads and Sedentary Population"
 tribal_estate_events.1.d: "The difference between tax collection, extortion or demanding tribute can sometimes be somewhat vague. In many parts of our country taxes are collected by the Nomadic Clans in ways very similar to how they would have conducted themselves during a raid.\nToday an emissary from some of our more well-to-do subjects arrived to tell a tale of how the would-be tax collectors pillaged their lands and then laid siege to their fortified homes. They now demand retribution from the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and for the perpetrators to be punished. The tribes would, however, likely not take kindly to any such restrictions of their conduct."
 tribal_estate_events.1.a: "Reprimand the Chiefs."
 tribal_estate_events.1.b: "Support the Chiefs."
 tribal_estate_events.2.t: "Growth of Tribal Influence"
 tribal_estate_events.2.d: "A tribal state is always somewhat unstable. Some clans will quickly increase their influence over the others, only to collapse again just as suddenly. Lately a new group of tribal leaders have come to extend their power over the lesser tribes considerably."
 tribal_estate_events.2.a: "Ok."
 tribal_estate_events.3.t: "Decline of Tribal Influence"
 tribal_estate_events.3.d: "Due to infighting between clans, poorly thought out political maneuvers and conflicts relating to succession our influence over the other tribes has increased considerably during the last few years. This decline in tribal influence is unlikely to last but comes as a nice respite for now."
 tribal_estate_events.3.a: "Ok."
 tribal_estate_events.4.t: "Local Chiefs Complain"
 tribal_estate_events.4.d: "Several Clan Chiefs have complained to us about young men from their area leaving their clans and joining our own army. They claim that this is not how it was done in the days of our father, and that every man should serve in his local clan's army first. What shall we do?"
 tribal_estate_events.4.a: "Send the young men home."
 tribal_estate_events.4.b: "Keep them in the army."
 tribal_estate_events.5.t: "Chiefs are withholding Taxes"
 tribal_estate_events.5.d: "One of our closest advisors has come to us with proof of the local Chiefs not paying much tax to us as one should expect from their lands. This is a delicate situation, but we need to come to a decision quickly."
 tribal_estate_events.5.a: "Their land, their rules!"
 tribal_estate_events.5.b: "They bend knee to ME!"
 tribal_estate_events.6.t: "Our Horde is in disarray!"
 tribal_estate_events.6.d: "Keeping nomadic tribes together is never an easy task and right now we are living through some dire times. The $ESTATE_NOMADIC_TRIBES$ could very likely help us stabilize the situation so that we can get back on our feet but we would be increasing their influence over our state."
 tribal_estate_events.6.a: "Rely on the $ESTATE_NOMADIC_TRIBES$!"

 EST_VAL_TRIBES_STABILIY_BOOSTED: "Stabilized the Horde: §Y$VAL$%§!"
 tribal_estate_events.7.t: "Our Tribes view the Horde as weak!"
 tribal_estate_events.7.d: "Our military leadership is inexperienced and weak. The $ESTATE_NOMADIC_TRIBES$ are questioning if they can really follow such green men into battle, offering instead to supply us with seasoned warriors ready to lead our troops."
 tribal_estate_events.7.a: "Rely on the $ESTATE_NOMADIC_TRIBES$!"
 tribal_estate_events.7.b: "We do not need their help."
 tribal_estate_events.8.t: "The Horde is not unified!"
 tribal_estate_events.8.d: "Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has proven [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] unable to keep the [Root.GetAdjective] unified and the $ESTATE_NOMADIC_TRIBES$ worry that we are becoming the object of ridicule. Prominent clan leaders have approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] offering to strengthen our rule though some would say that relying on others to enforce this unity makes for an unstable peace."
 tribal_estate_events.8.a: "Rely on the $ESTATE_NOMADIC_TRIBES$!"
 tribal_estate_events.8.b: "We do not need their help."

 tribal_estate_events.9.t: "Return to the Old Ways!"
 tribal_estate_events.9.d: "One of the Clan Chiefs has come forward, as a spokesman for their group, and urges us to return to the old ways, the ways that made us strong. 'Crush your enemies, drive them before you, and hear the lamentations of their women!'"
 tribal_estate_events.9.a: "That is what is good in life."
 tribal_estate_events.9.b: "That is in the past."
 tribal_estate_events.10.t: "Revolt of the [Root.GetName] $ESTATE_NOMADIC_TRIBES$"

 tribal_estate_events.10.a: "Ok."
 tribal_estate_events.11.t: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] after the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 tribal_estate_events.11.d: "A distant cousin of [Root.Monarch.GetName] has managed to gain the gratitude of the tribes. Many strong tribal leaders are now demanding that we change the future plans of succession to ensure that this cousin is guaranteed his rightful place as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Whether they are motivated by true loyalty to our kinsman or feel he could easily be controlled is hard to tell but they would certainly not take refusal to follow their advice very well."
 tribal_estate_events.11.a: "A new heir it is!"
 tribal_estate_events.11.b: "These tribes must know their place!"
 tribal_estate_events.12.t: "Tribes demand more men"
 tribal_estate_events.12.d: "Prominent Tribal leaders have approached us demanding that we let them make use of the state resources to defend their lands. They claim that neighboring states are making incursions and raids into the land they control and that the only efficient way to defend them is to put some of our troops directly under their command."
 tribal_estate_events.12.a: "Of course they shall have our men!"
 tribal_estate_events.12.b: "This is an excuse to weaken us!"

 tribal_estate_events.13.d: "Several leaders of the powerful $ESTATE_NOMADIC_TRIBES$ in our country have approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to complain about the unfair interference of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] representatives. The $ESTATE_NOMADIC_TRIBES$ feel they should be left alone in accordance with their ancient rights."
 tribal_estate_events.13.a: "We must leave them alone then."
 tribal_estate_events.13.a.tt: "Provinces which make up the §YTribes§! Estate's land share will gain §R35§! Autonomy."

As we rely on them for most military matters this will result in quite a strain on our remaining leadership."

 church_estate_events.1.d: "The $ESTATE_CHURCH$ has long been one of the foremost pillars of the [Root.GetAdjective] realm, providing not only spiritual guidance but also administrators, judges and diplomats for the benefit of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. In return for these great services no ecclesiastical manor, monastery or other estate pay any taxes to the state and the temporal authorities do not meddle in the internal affairs of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$.\nTimes grow dire, however, and the state has to cover an increasing number of expenses.

In return for these great services many donations have been made over the years, both by the state and by others, to the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ and the gods they serve.

 church_estate_events.2.d: "The power of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ has never relied on the state itself. Rather it is in many ways the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ who through their ties to the spiritual realm lend their legitimacy to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].

 church_estate_events.3.d: "More than any other Estate the influence of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ is dependent on their standing with the common man. It has been hard to put the finger at exactly why but over the recent years the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ has come to be seen less as the spiritual guardians of our country and more as rich and corrupted intrigue-makers. Combined with some unfortunate investments in the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ properties themselves and poor political maneuvering the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ have been losing both power and influence."

 church_estate_events.5.d: "Relations between the state and the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ has now sunk low enough that it is entirely characterized by distrust and even open defiance. The Holy Places of our nation are centers of resistance to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and most of the faithful in our lands are doubting the legitimacy of our rule.\nWith things as they are it comes as no surprise that all it took for the situation to ignite was one small misstep by our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] during a religious ceremony last week.

There isn't a single institution in our country that isn't entirely under the influence of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ and the power of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] depends on them now more than ever.\nIt is perhaps only natural that the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ now also wishes to take a more active role in the practical ruling of our country. Lately a number of suggestions have been made by their representatives to further harmonize our laws and traditions with those of the spiritual realm. The ambition is to cleanse our court culture from any unorthodoxy and to ensure that the country is governed according to religiously sound rules and ideals."

A long tradition of close cooperation and loyalty between us and $ESTATE_CHURCH$ has resulted in a situation where the Church thinks of itself as a part of the state administration rather than an independent actor.

 church_estate_events.8.d: "Many land donations are quite old and while they are always written down both landscape and names may well have changed since a donation was originally written. Recently the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ have been accusing several members of the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ of outright land theft in the form of encroaching on lands donated to the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ long ago. The $ESTATE_NOBLES$ on the other hand argue that it is the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ who are trying to seize land areas they do not own.\nWhoever we decide to side with will become the majority land holder in the area."

 church_estate_events.9.d: "There has always been some discrepancy between the religion actually taught and defended by the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ and the actual faith of the people in the provinces. Most of the time the differences are small enough that the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ chooses to ignore them to instead focus on reinforce the more orthodox spiritual ideas of the people.\nIt seems, however, that certain ideas that are quite unorthodox, if rooted in old traditions, have begun to spread together with the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith among our non-[Root.Religion.GetName] subjects. The resulting mix of old heathen ideas, popular superstitions and the actual [Root.Religion.GetName] itself has been quite too much for the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ to stomach even if it seems to have made conversion a much more attractive proposition for our heathen subjects."

The likely candidate is an old cleric with a solid history as a prominent member of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ behind him. He has, however, also acquired many enemies during his life who now hope to see a somewhat younger candidate with a less ugly past be appointed. As [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] it would not be hard to influence this election to the younger candidate who would likely be more loyal. To be seen to meddle in the affairs of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$, however, would very likely weaken the faction in the long run."

 church_estate_events.12.a: "Ok."
 nobles_estate_events.1.t: "Noble Birth"
 nobles_estate_events.1.d: "Many of the families of the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ won their current position due to the actions of a forefather who served the state in times of war. For most of their sons a life in the field is therefore the only imaginable career. With the modernization of the army, however, common officers are no longer entirely unusual. Members of the Nobility have now approached us asking that we guarantee what they feel is the given right of their class. No man should be able to take service as a commander in the [Root.GetAdjective] armies who is not of noble birth!"
 nobles_estate_events.1.a: "Guarantee their right to command our armies."

 nobles_estate_events.2.d: "The state is not the sole source of influence in our country. Over the last few decades a charismatic champion of the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ has successfully managed to increase the power of the leading families of the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ over most of the institutions of our country.\nContacts and privileges can be powerful things, especially combined with ambition."
 nobles_estate_events.2.a: "Ok."
 nobles_estate_events.3.t: "Encroachment of the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ in [noble_encroachment.GetName]"
 nobles_estate_events.3.d: "It's hard to monitor everyone everywhere all the time and the boundaries between individual land properties are often grounded in old traditions or documents written when the landscape may have looked quite different. For someone with the right resources this can be exploited. A number of prominent $ESTATE_NOBLES$ families have used their considerable influence in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] to get away with expanding their properties in [noble_encroachment.GetName] considerably. If we want to protect the property of the state we must act soon."
 nobles_estate_events.3.a: "Let it slide."
 nobles_estate_events.3.b: "Demand that the land be returned."
 nobles_estate_events.4.t: "Tyrannical Nobles"
 nobles_estate_events.4.d: "A representative of the people living in an area dominated by one of the most prominent families of the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ has approached the throne today imploring the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to take action against what he claims are systematic abuses of power against the people there. As the ruler of [Root.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has a responsibility to protect his people, not doing so will make us appear weak and may harm the long-term growth of the province. The $ESTATE_NOBLES$ would likely not take kindly to chastising such a powerful member of their ranks however."
 nobles_estate_events.4.a: "Turn a blind eye."
 nobles_estate_events.4.b: "Chastise the landowner."
 nobles_estate_events.5.t: "Declining Power of the $ESTATE_NOBLES$"
 nobles_estate_events.5.d: "As both influential land owners and the traditional warrior class in our state the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ have not fared well lately. Through a combination of excessive infighting and poorly coordinated power plays the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ have lost influence in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] and many have retired to their properties in the countryside."
 nobles_estate_events.5.a: "Ok."
 nobles_estate_events.6.t: "$ESTATE_NOBLES$ demand Stricter Sumptuary Laws"
 nobles_estate_events.6.d: "Expensive clothes, great banquettes and impressive palaces are some of the most visible symbols of the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ but the degree to which one family has money to spend on such things can vary greatly. In some cases the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ of our country are able to spend just as lavishly if not more so than the average noble. While there are old rules and traditions restricting such things for those of less noble birth these are hard to enforce efficiently. This is unacceptable to the powerful $ESTATE_NOBLES$ of our country who are now demanding that we update our laws on what an outsider can and cannot wear. They now suggest a number of heavy fines for anyone trying to rise visibly above their betters."

 nobles_estate_events.7.d: "In time many of the everyday occurrences in the life of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] predecessors has become the subject of ceremony. Being able to attend the bedroom of the ruler as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] dresses for instance is considered by many to be the best way to gain the ear of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. An elaborate court life will certainly limit the power of our nobles to plot against us in their countryside properties but it could also prove quite expensive. Denying them the right to be part of the daily life of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] entirely on the other hand would also limit their influence but the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ would likely resent it."
 nobles_estate_events.7.a: "Let's keep it at a modest level."

 nobles_estate_events.7.c: "We have no need of such things."
 nobles_estate_events.8.t: "Deteriorating Relations with the $ESTATE_NOBLES$"
 nobles_estate_events.8.d: "Relations between the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] could hardly be worse. The great sense of distrust is plainly visible by the almost deserted court in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] as most prominent families keep to their countryside manors. Unless we do something soon state authority will deteriorate in the areas controlled by the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ but any demands from the state will likely be met with arms in hand at this point."

 nobles_estate_events.8.b: "Force them to accept state authority."
 nobles_estate_events.9.t: "Insubordinate $ESTATE_NOBLES$"
 nobles_estate_events.9.d: "None of our subjects are more associated with war than the $ESTATE_NOBLES$. Generations ago their families served us or the states before us and won their current status on the field of battle. Ever since then most of them have kept their old traditions alive, training for a life in the field and making connections with others of the same inclination.\nThe current state of affairs in our country, however, has left us with few members of the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ willing to fight our battles. Insubordination has become widespread among the higher officers and we have good reason to suspect more than a few hope for an unsuccessful war."
 nobles_estate_events.9.a: "Unfortunate."

 nobles_estate_events.10.d: "As the state and its bureaucracy grow there is an ever-growing need of people to oversee and administrate various lands and functions. The [Root.GetNobilityOrFallbackName] have traditionally been more associated with military services to the state but have increasingly made it clear that they still expect to be first in line when government offices are being handed out. The [Root.GetBurghersOrFallbackName] on the other hand claim that the [Root.GetNobilityOrFallbackName] considers such appointments as mere rewards and will use them only to enrich themselves. Instead the [Root.GetBurghersOrFallbackName] argue we should appoint men out of individual merit.\nThe unexpected death of a trusted secretary has left a vacant position to be filled at the center of this conflict, with the [Root.GetBurghersOrFallbackName] supporting one candidate and the [Root.GetNobilityOrFallbackName] expecting us to pick another. While both candidates are talented men this has to be a political decision."

 burghers_estate_events.1.d: "The status of the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ does not rest on the same old traditions as that of the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ or the $ESTATE_CHURCH$. Instead they have had to make their own fortunes by working diligently and then risking the profit to again expand their businesses. As a rule, however, this has gone very well for them lately. While not as prestigious business is in many ways the backbone of our economy and through their control of the coins the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ have managed to increase their power over our country."
 burghers_estate_events.1.a: "Ok."
 burghers_estate_events.2.t: "Robber Barons"
 burghers_estate_events.2.d: "The $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ are concerned with the great influence of the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ in our state. They claim that many lower members of the nobility are disregarding the peace and law of the land, using their position of power and the lands they hold to take up unreasonable tolls and taxes for traders passing by. Some are even said to attack and waylay merchants, robbing or extorting them of their money.\nRepresentatives of the [Root.GetAdjective] $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ now claim that the economic development of our country is held back by these excesses. The $ESTATE_NOBLES$ on the other hand argue that they are simply charging reasonably for the use of their roads property. Some are willing to give the state a part of the share they take."
 burghers_estate_events.2.a: "They only take what is their right."

 burghers_estate_events.3.d: "Without the old privileges and pedigrees of other factions the status and influence of the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ is rarely quite as secure as that of those born into power.

Should we provide them with these means to grow they assure us that the economy of the area would quickly improve, resulting in more wealth for the state."
 burghers_estate_events.4.a: "Accept the Petition."
 burghers_estate_events.4.b: "Reject the Petition."
 burghers_estate_events.5.t: "Immoral Prices"
 burghers_estate_events.5.d: "Grain prices are notoriously unstable, anything from the weather where it is grown to incidents hurting its distribution can suddenly cause the price to rise significantly. As a result of one such sudden change there is currently an acute shortage of grain in many of our larger cities. Desperate to feed themselves the common people are directing their anger at the merchants who they feel are making good use of this situation to overcharge for their wares. The merchants themselves on the other hand claim that this is a natural result of the shortage and that there simply isn't enough bread to go around."
 burghers_estate_events.5.a: "Force the Merchants to lower their prices."
 burghers_estate_events.5.b: "We should not meddle in these things."
 burghers_estate_events.5.c: "We must pay for and distribute what bread there is."
 burghers_estate_events.6.t: "Parallel Authority"
 burghers_estate_events.6.d: "The $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ are not the sole authority within their cities, the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ also have a strong presence in most big cities going back to their initial founding. Conflicts sometimes arise when the councils of the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ implement rules that the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ disapprove of.\nSuch conflicts have become more and more commonplace and members of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ are openly acting in defiance of the various rules the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ have agreed upon in their cities. Delegates from various cities dominated by the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ are now urging us to clarify the situation."

 burghers_estate_events.6.b: "Side with the $ESTATE_CHURCH$."
 burghers_estate_events.7.t: "Extended Privileges for the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$"
 burghers_estate_events.7.d: "The $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ feel that they are unduly taxed and regulated when taking in mind the great importance of their work for our country. Tolls, taxes and various tariffs are holding them back from being able to accomplish even greater things and they will not hesitate to use all of their influence to abolish them."
 burghers_estate_events.7.a: "Let us remove these obstacles!"
 burghers_estate_events.7.b: "The $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ need to know their place!"
 burghers_estate_events.8.t: "Hurtful Trade Policies"
 burghers_estate_events.8.d: "The interests of prominent merchant households are being hurt by our repressive trade policies towards other countries. The $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ support these families and have now petitioned us to compensate them by at least opening up some other restrictions on trade to compensate for their loss of income."
 burghers_estate_events.8.a: "We must support the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$."
 burghers_estate_events.8.b: "We cannot let our trade policy be decided by these peddlers."
 burghers_estate_events.9.t: "Cottage Industry"
 burghers_estate_events.9.d: "Economic development is not always without conflict. It seems rich merchants in some of our $ESTATE_BURGHERS$-dominated cities have been attempting to bypass various guild privileges by outsourcing work to the homes of families living outside the city. The fact that this 'Putting-out System' has been a very profitable strategy only further enflames the anger of the artisans in the city, who feel their ancient rights have been trampled and that the carefully managed prices of their products will suffer. The [Root.GetAdjective] artisans now turn to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to defend their privileges as the city council has been unable to root out competition from outside the city."
 burghers_estate_events.9.a: "We cannot stand in the way of progress."
 burghers_estate_events.9.b: "We must safeguard the guild privileges."
 burghers_estate_events.10.t: "Social Mobility"
 burghers_estate_events.10.d: "The growing power of the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ has led to individuals from within their ranks to seek their fortunes in areas traditionally dominated by other groups. The sons of mid to low prominence families of the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ now have the education and the ambition to match the more privileged classes and as a result an increasing number of them are now being employed as administrators, lawyers, officers as well as in other positions traditionally dominated by another estate. The $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ still feel they are being unduly held back by the archaic rights and privileges of another era but their adversaries are growing very weary of the current 'unnatural' social mobility.\nUnless we do something we risk losing the support of the privileged classes but if we withdraw our support of the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ at this point this will likely have grave effects on our relations with them."
 burghers_estate_events.10.a: "We must not stand in the way of these new men."
 burghers_estate_events.10.b: "We must protect the ancient rights of the other Estates."
 burghers_estate_events.11.t: "Growth of the Economy"
 burghers_estate_events.11.d: "Our policy of cooperation with the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ has come to bear fruit in the form of economic development in many fields. The cities of the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ are prospering and our influence in international trade is growing rapidly."
 burghers_estate_events.11.a: "Great."
 burghers_estate_events.12.t: "The risks of Trade"
 burghers_estate_events.12.d: "Trade over large distances can be risky, if profitable. The weather, brigands and pirates remain a threat on land as well as on water. Normally the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ can cope with a certain amount of mishaps and have their own ways to protect themselves and insure their cargo. Lately, however, things have been going badly for a large number of Merchant families and some are at risk of bankruptcy. It may be prudent to offer some financial compensation to get them back on their feet."
 burghers_estate_events.12.a: "Compensate the Traders."
 burghers_estate_events.12.b: "They knew what they were getting into."
 burghers_estate_events.13.t: "Urbanization"
 burghers_estate_events.13.d: "While only a small portion of our population live in the cities the growing prosperity of the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ is attracting an increasing number of people from the countryside. Some cities are growing so quickly that existing problems in terms of sanitation and overcrowding have gone from troubling to catastrophic according to the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$. The poor have taken up residence outside the city walls where filthy suburbs have sprung up and disease thrives.\nThe $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ find the situation intolerable and are now requesting that the state step in to provide help both in terms of resources and enforcement of rules outside of the walls. Only this way can this increasing urbanization actually lead to something good."
 burghers_estate_events.13.a: "Attempt to improve conditions."
 burghers_estate_events.13.b: "This is nothing unusual, the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ can handle it."
 burghers_estate_events.14.t: "Economic Policy"
 burghers_estate_events.14.d: "As the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ grow in power their calls for fewer trade regulations and taxes become more and more frequent. Many feel our country has an old-fashioned and repressive trade policy and that we would benefit from reducing the amount of taxes and tolls that hinder commerce."
 burghers_estate_events.14.a: "Reduce Mercantilism."
 burghers_estate_events.14.b: "Refuse to change the Trade Policy."
 burghers_estate_events.15.t: "Protests among the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$"
 burghers_estate_events.15.d: "The continuously deteriorating relationship between the state and the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ has reached the point where there is little trust at all for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] in our major cities. Every state initiative is suspected at being aimed to contain the power of the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ and tax evasion has become widespread.\nIt has now come to the point that a number of guilds have begun a general strike, demanding greater autonomy and freedom from the overbearing state."

 dhimmi_estate_events.1.d: "The Qadi in one of our major cities has been using his influence to interpret Islamic law as well as the edicts of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] a bit too zealously. Not content to keep the status quo in the largely non-Muslim city he has been trying to actively force the non-believers to convert while systematically closing down their centers of worship.\nAfter a recent suicide by a force-converted trader non-Muslims are now leaving the city en masse to settle somewhere more welcoming. While even the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ largely seem to find these actions too extreme they would likely consider any action taken against the Qadi to be much worse."

 dhimmi_estate_events.1.b: "Replace the Qadi and try to make amends."
 dhimmi_estate_events.2.t: "Demands to lessen Taxes on Heathens"
 dhimmi_estate_events.2.d: "As our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was on his way to the weekly procession to the royal Mosque a large number of $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ had assembled in front of the building, preventing the passage of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and demanding that some of the discriminatory taxes against non-Muslims such as the temple or pilgrimage taxes be revoked."
 dhimmi_estate_events.2.a: "Trample the dissenters!"
 dhimmi_estate_events.2.b: "Revoke some of the Taxes!"
 dhimmi_estate_events.3.t: "Religious Pragmatism"
 dhimmi_estate_events.3.d: "While not everyone may like it the non-Muslims in our realm have been growing in influence over the last few years. Members of the Dhimmi are frequently seen even among the more important Trade Guilds of our country and many serve as administrators in our provinces or have been allowed to keep their hereditary titles."
 dhimmi_estate_events.3.a: "Ok."

 dhimmi_estate_events.4.d: "While they make up an important part of our society the non-Muslims have lately been losing ground to other groups.

 dhimmi_estate_events.5.d: "Many among the Muslim $ESTATE_NOBLES$ have been voicing complaints at what they feel is an unjust and unfair favoring of infidels in our government. Having sought the support of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ they now claim that we are running our country contrary to established Islamic customs and that we must ensure that the infidel are kept out of positions of influence.\nThe construction of a new shrine in a province largely dominated by the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ entirely funded by local nobles and merchants has escalated the situation further with the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ and the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ demanding that we tear down the holy building and put the infidels in their place."

 dhimmi_estate_events.6.d: "Traditionally the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ are excluded from service in many of the higher positions in the administration. Instead these are generally given to faithful Muslim literati. As our government apparatus grows, however, it has a constant thirst for more learned men and among the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ there are many that would fit this description. While some would consider it unorthodox we could probably greatly benefit from recruiting from their numbers."

 dhimmi_estate_events.6.b: "We cannot risk their assimilative capabilities."
 dhimmi_estate_events.7.t: "Infidel Brigands"
 dhimmi_estate_events.7.d: "The quickly deteriorating relations between the state and the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ have resulted in local relations breaking down entirely in some areas. Tax collectors tell tales of convoys vanishing on the route between areas dominated by the Dhimmi, together with what had been collected. In the cities the priests and leaders of the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ agitate against us and it has become increasingly hard to keep track of our subjects even within the walls. Even those opposed to $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ influence now find that they question our ability to rule."

 dhimmi_estate_events.8.t: "Riches of the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$"
 dhimmi_estate_events.8.d: "Throughout the Islamic world the term $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ has come to be applied to a wide and disparate variety of people. The traditional and more restrictive definition of only Christians and Jews has quickly been abandoned by Muslim states where the majority populations are Hindus or Buddhists. Regardless of who are included the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ receive protection in exchange for being exempt from many of the laws of the realm.\nWhile this may seem unfortunate for them it is quite fortunate for us right now, while the general economy is currently still recovering from recent wars many families of the Dhimmi still hold quite large cash reserves and they have no laws or rules forbidding them from investing or lending it to others."
