 pirates.11.b: "The captain's word is law."
 pirates.12.t: "Division of Plunder"
 pirates.12.d: "Our latest prize turned out to be carrying a much more valuable cargo than expected. This fact has not yet been revealed to the crews, who would expect and demand that the additional plunder be added to their share. The captains of the involved ships wish sequester the money to refit their ships and purchase additional cannon, while the fence’s representative argues that it is best spent on bribing officials in legitimate ports. As an argument breaks out, a drunken crewman stumbles into the room and hears too much."
 pirates.12.a: "Divide it evenly amongst the crew."
 pirates.12.b: "The fence will take their cut."
 pirates.12.c: "The Captain will receive an extra share."
 pirates.13.t: "Forged Shipping Manifests"
 pirates.13.d: "Piracy is a dangerous business, but smuggling can carry just as much risk if the proper precautions are not taken. Our smugglers make their profits by purchasing stolen goods from pirate crews and selling them on for profit in legitimate markets. To sell these illegally acquired goods the smugglers must bribe port officials to ignore their origin or else present passable documents that proclaim their legitimacy.\n\n[Root.skilled_forger.GetName], a skilled forger, has recently entered our service and procured for us a number of documents that should be accepted in almost any port, ensuring that our operations will continue to run smoothly."
 pirates.13.a: "This is good for business."
 pirates.14.t: "Privateer Defects"
 pirates.14.d: "The privateer Captain [Root.defecting_privateer.GetName] has made quite a name for himself in the service of the [privateer_origin_country.GetAdjective] Navy. The payment he has been receiving for his prizes however is much less than the full value of the prizes themselves. Like many savvy privateers, [Root.defecting_privateer.GetName] has realized that he could make a greater profit by turning pirate. He has tossed his Letter of Marque overboard and made port in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]. As a pirate of [Root.GetName] he will be free to plunder to his heart’s content and keep the spoils he has rightfully stolen."
 pirates.14.a: "To profit and plunder!"
 pirates.15.t: "Slave Ship Captured"
 pirates.15.d: "After boarding our latest prize we discovered the cargo holds to be packed with captive slaves. Many among our crews have experienced the horrors of slavery for themselves, and naturally their first instinct was to demand that the slaves be freed and incorporated into the crew.\n\nThe less scrupulous crewmen with a particular lust for gold would prefer to instead treat these people as cargo and sell them on to the fence as such. There will be nothing in the way of moneyed compensation for their efforts to take this prize, they argue, if we refuse to profit from trading in slaves."
 pirates.15.a: "Liberate them! Let them live free in [Root.GetName]."
 pirates.15.b: "They are just cargo to be sold for profit."
 pirates.16.t: "Careening"
 pirates.16.d: "It is time once again to careen the ships. This arduous process requires the crews to drag the ships onto a secure beach at high tide and safely lower them onto their sides to expose the hull for repairs. It is a task dreaded by every pirate, not only because the risk of damage to the ship and injury to the crew is high but because of the backbreaking labor they must perform to see the job done right. Several advocates among the crew feel that a more relaxed approach should be taken to careening, despite the captain’s insistence that failing to make the proper repairs will cause far more problems down the line."
 pirates.16.a: "Ensure the crews do a thorough job."
 pirates.16.b: "Let the crews relax."
 pirates.17.t: "Smugglers Struggling"
 pirates.17.d: "Even at the best of times there it is difficult to smuggle contraband into foreign ports. These are most certainly not the best of times. Many of our smugglers are returning to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] having had their goods confiscated. Some do not return at all and await the gallows."
 pirates.17.a: "Unfortunate."
 pirates.18.t: "Electing a Quartermaster"
 pirates.18.d: "As the previous quartermaster of the [Root.GetFlagshipName] appears to have taken a long walk off a short plank, we find ourselves in need of a new candidate for the role. A quartermaster has a unique position on a pirate ship. Elected by the crew, he is expected to be their representative and to champion their needs against the often arbitrary authority of the captain.\n\nTwo candidates immediately present themselves. [Root.crew_representative.GetName] is a true advocate for the crew; he has both the humility to listen to their concerns and the fortitude to stand up to the captain. Meanwhile [Root.captains_puppet.GetName] is firmly in the Captain’s pocket; he is skilled at manipulating the crew into believing that the Captain’s wishes are also their own. Who will win the hearts and minds of the assembled pirates?"
 pirates.18.a: "[Root.crew_representative.GetName], a voice for the crew."
 pirates.18.b: "[Root.captains_puppet.GetName], the Captain's puppet."
 pirates.19.t: "Crew Blacklisted"
 pirates.19.d: "The crew of the [Root.GetRandomShipName] are a menace. Though they have an excellent record of delivering prizes, as soon as they make port their drunkenness and violence cause so much damage and disruption in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] that many wonder if they are worth the trouble they cause.\n\n After a particularly destructive episode, the local smuggling consortium has decided to blacklist the entire crew, making them unable to sell their plunder anywhere in [Root.GetName]. This has caused upset among the pirates that call the island home; they believe their natural rights to live as they please are being violated, and several rabble-rousers compare the smugglers to snobbish aristocrats."
 pirates.19.a: "Maintain the ban."
 pirates.19.b: "Lift the ban."
 pirates.20.t: "The Golden Age of Piracy"
 pirates.20.d: "Wars between colonial powers are bloody affairs that leave a legacy of devastation and villainy in their wake. Piracy has become rampant in the Caribbean. Former privateers have raised the black flag as they discover that peacetime is bad for profits, while naval captains disenfranchised by the outcome of the wars disavow their former sovereigns. The conflict between great powers has thus inadvertently ushered in a Golden Age of piracy."

He has objected to the treatment of natives in the American colonies and been outspoken about our harsh colonial policies.\n\nHaving renounced his own past as a participant in our efforts, he has now come before [Root.Monarch.GetName] to convince [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to be more lenient in our treatment of the native population."

 order_events.2.t: "Malleus Maleficarum"
 order_events.2.d: "A book on witchcraft, believed to originally have been authored somewhere in central Europe, has surfaced in a local Dominican convent in [maleficarum_province.GetName]. Malleus Maleficarum, Hammer of Witches, not only warns of the dangers posed by witches to society, but prescribes methods for how to deal with them. It categorizes the practice of such sorcery as heretical, and insists that the courts adopt the prosecute and punish it accordingly.\n\nAlthough the Dominicans in [maleficarum_province.GetName] are far from united on the validity of the book, some believe it originates within the order. Its fate continues to be the subject of debate."
 order_events.2.a: "Spread this wisdom throughout the land!"

In [dominican_university_province.GetName], they have found themselves without a such a center and are attempting to found one themselves. They have provided considerable funding, but are now seeking the support of the [Root.GetAdjective] crown in their endeavor."

 order_events.4.t: "Prosecution of the Fraticelli"
 order_events.4.d: "The followers of Saint Francis all embrace a life of poverty and humility, but some go further in their rejection of wealth. A group of [Root.GetAdjective] Franciscans have taken a harder line, questioning the piousness of both higher church officials as well as other orders who own property. They point to the life of Christ and the apostles as free of the opulence of the present church.\n\nDominican Inquisitor [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] points to these views being dangerously close to the Fraticelli, heretics prosecuted by the inquisition. [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHeCap] suggests putting these so-called Franciscans on trial and letting [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] order take over their duties in the region from now on."
 order_events.4.a: "Oust the heretics and invite another order."
 order_events.4.b: "[Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] is overstepping [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] purview."
 order_events.5.t: "Mediation Between the Branches"
 order_events.5.d: "Several attempts have been made in the past to unify the branches of the Franciscan order. They have so far been unsuccessful, owing largely to the differences in principles between the branches being too great. [PAP.Monarch.GetTitle] [PAP.Monarch.GetName] has no such ambitions, but must still decide whether to try to consolidate the branches of this often divisive order, or sanction their differences. With its considerable influence over the Papacy, [Root.GetName] is in a unique position to affect these developments."

 order_events.6.t: "Offshoot Order"
 order_events.6.d: "Rather than a single order, the Franciscans are in practice a group of orders all following the Rule of Saint Francis. The formation of such orders is not entirely a phenomenon of the past. Sometimes congregations will deviate from established practices, especially in the wake of disagreements within the Church.\n\nA group of Franciscans in [franciscan_origin_province.GetName] have requested to leave their congregation, seeking to move to [franciscan_target_province.GetName] to live a life they claim is more in line with Saint Francis teachings. Should we permit such fragmentations?"
 order_events.6.a: "As long as they call themselves Franciscans, it is acceptable."
 order_events.6.b: "Only under the eye of the established order."
 order_events.6.c: "Crush this heresy at once!"
 order_events.7.t: "Jesuits Call for Reform"
 order_events.7.d: "Nobody doubts the sincerity of the Jesuit order's effort to protect the Catholic faith from the Protestant heresies. Their calls for reform within the church have been acknowledged in [Root.GetName] as part of the Counter-Reformation. Even so, these attempts to rid our institutions of perceived corruption and greed sometimes put them at odds with other representatives of the church.\n\nAs Protestantism has spread in their midst, Jesuits are confident that they can restore order and authority if only some concessions are made regarding the misgivings these converts had with local bishops in the first place. Can they be trusted to handle this tactfully?"
 order_events.7.a: "If this helps them convert the heretics, we will allow it."

Now confident that they have all the resources they need in the current colony, they look to establish a new mission nearby. With our blessing and promise to aid their future efforts, they believe they already have enough people to lay a significant foundation in this untamed land, both for [Root.GetName] and for the Catholic faith."

 order_events.9.d: "The Jesuit order wields considerable influence, which can make even academic disagreements with the Papacy quite controversial. A recent debate over theological matters in [order_events_9_prov.GetAreaName] has caused conflict between [Root.GetAdjective] Jesuits and some of the cardinals. [PAP.Monarch.GetTitle] [PAP.Monarch.GetName] is now concerned that this will weaken the current doctrine in [Root.GetName], even as the debate is only meant to be an internal matter. We may be forced to take a side on this, if not publicly, then at least to the parties involved."

Prince Joan was long married to Queen Blanche of Navarra, who sadly died in the spring of the Year of Our Lord 1441. Rather than the Navarrese kingdom passing to their son Karlos, Joan was able to secure the throne for himself and now rules as King of Navarra in his own right. The consequence of this is that the Crowns of Aragon and Navarra will be united if King Alfons dies while Joan still lives, so long as Navarra remains an independent nation."

Fleeing to neighboring province is one way, since [expelling_province.GetName] is the primary target of our efforts.\n\nWhile this is clearly an attempt to interfere with our plan, trying to stop people from settling nearby will not mean that they comply with the original plan. More likely, they will scatter elsewhere, bringing the situation even further from our control."
 expel_minority_events.4.a: "At least this way, we know where they are going."
 expel_minority_events.4.b: "Such attempts at defiance will not be tolerated!"
 expel_minority_events.5.t: "Administrative Officials Expelled"
 expel_minority_events.5.d: "The people being moved to our colony in [expelling_colony.GetName] from [expelling_province.GetName] are not only commonfolk. Many of them have served important roles in administering [expelling_province.GetName], sometimes as a bridge between [Root.GetAdjective] leaders and the locals. Now that they are being expelled, the province will be more difficult to manage, forcing us to make some concessions. Either we take a more off-hands approach to administering [expelling_province.GetName] until the positions can be filled, or we hurry along our plans to have less people to manage."
 expel_minority_events.5.a: "The positions will have to be vacant for the time being."
 expel_minority_events.5.b: "We'll simply have to send people abroad at a faster rate."
