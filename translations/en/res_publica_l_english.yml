 dutch_republic.1.t: "Absolute Power"
 dutch_republic.1.d: "We take pride in our [Root.GovernmentName], in part precisely because it is unprecedented and stands in contrast to the oppression suffered in other nations. However, an increased number of nobles are pointing to the international trend of absolutism, where one ruler exercises unrestricted power, gaining popularity among neighboring nations.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName], they argue, has all the makings of a great ruler. Granting more power to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] could strengthen the nation and show other rulers we approve of their ideas."
 dutch_republic.1.a: "Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is the state!"
 dutch_republic.1.b: "We have nothing to learn from foreign tyrants!"
 dutch_republic.2.t: "Political Maxims of the [Root.GovernmentName]"
 dutch_republic.2.da: "One of the [Root.GetName]'s most respected advisors, $STATESMAN$$DIPLOMAT$$TRADER$$COLONIAL_GOVERNOR$, has recently published a work discussing the political principles the republican form of government depends on. While certainly well written and convincingly argued, some of the material is strongly critical of the hold the Princes of Orange have had on the office of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] recently. The advisor's loyalty to [Root.Monarch.GetName] may be less unwavering than we thought."

Those who adhere to other faiths don't always have kind words for the princes of Orange, with some using our republican ideals as an excuse to openly challenge the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the state church."

 dutch_republic.3.b: "Let us ease the situation by toning down our own propaganda."
 dutch_republic.4.t: "The [Root.GovernmentName] and Free Trade"
 dutch_republic.4.d: "With a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] like [Root.Monarch.GetName], most nobles agree that there is no need for elections, which would only destabilize and weaken the [Root.GetAdjective] nation. Many traders disagree. They find the institutions of the republic, including free elections, to be crucial in ensuring [Root.GetName]'s continued economic priorities.\n\nUnder an autocratic [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] with expansionistic ambitions, the free trade and liberty they have enjoyed in the past may be threatened. If the current [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is to rule for life, they demand that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] shows dedication to these ideals."
 dutch_republic.4.a: "What they demand is irrelevant. They are subjects of the [Root.GovernmentName] and must comply."
 dutch_republic.4.b: "We may concede some of their points and reform accordingly."
 dutch_republic.5.t: "The King in [Root.GetName]"
 dutch_republic.5.da: "The House of Orange has enjoyed increased support in [Root.GetName] lately. As a result, their proponents have grown bolder. Those within the church speak of the Princes of Orange in royal terms, comparing them to ancient biblical kings. Our people have not forgotten their role in securing our nation's sovereignty and being praised as the last in a line of saviors certainly benefits [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Nevertheless, calling [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] a king, even in the context of a sermon, risks weakening our republican institutions."

 dutch_republic.6.da: "Although still maintaining a hold on the position of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the rule over [Root.GetName], the influence of the Orangists has fallen slightly in recent times. Nobles who sought power by aligning themselves with the family are increasingly coming to view this as a sign that the House of Orange, despite its legacy, is still at the mercy of the bureaucracy and political environment of the republic.\n\nSome of those who have formed the backbone of our armed forces are requesting that [Root.Monarch.GetName] commits to asserting power more clearly in military matters. None of their suggestions contribute to very constructive purposes, but may impress the old guard."

 dutch_republic.7.da: "Despite the monopoly the Orange family holds on the office of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], [Root.GetName] has seen a current of republican ideals recently. Statists have viewed this as a sign that our nation may very well be on its way towards their goal of a full-fledged republic, with some even going as far as praising the Prince of Orange for permitting this shift. Regardless of how much truth there is to this, our recent political maneuvering keeps the dream of the Dutch Republic alive."

 dutch_republic.8.da: "The Orangists already wield great influence over the [Root.GetAdjective] rule, and the latest developments in the political arena have only served to strengthen their grip on our supposed republic. Some of our previously loyal subjects have taken this as a sign that the priorities of [Root.GetName] have shifted and that a time is coming when tax money will be wasted on vain pursuits of noble families. Down this road, they claim, lie only petty wars and tyranny. In protest, many people are refusing to pay taxes to support this government."

 dutch_republic.9.da: "The reign of [Root.Monarch.GetName] is all but absolute. The Princes of Orange have secured power over [Root.GetName] for a long time ahead. Everything points to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] ruling for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] entire life.\n\n$SPYMASTER$, one of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] closest advisors, agrees with this assessment. This is a person fiercely loyal to their country, so loyal, in fact, that they would personally take the life of anyone who threatens the republic. In a recent meeting with a few carefully selected people, $SPYMASTER$ let it be known that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]self and the Orangists' stranglehold on the rulership is perhaps the biggest threat of all. $SPYMASTER$ can assure that the lifetime rule will be a short one."

 dutch_republic.10.t: "Republican Ideals Betrayed"
 dutch_republic.10.da: "The Princes of Orange command almost unquestioned loyalty. Free elections seem to be a thing of the past, despite our nation calling itself a republic. The Statists are no longer the only ones who question the integrity of republican institutions in [Root.GetName]; rather, it's growing increasingly uncommon to refer to these concepts at all. However noble the goals of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the underpinnings of our government form are slipping away."

 dutch_republic.10.a: "We'll replace them with ideals of our own design."
 dutch_republic.11.t: "Suggest Act of Seclusion"
 dutch_republic.11.d: "There is peace between us and the Dutch Republic... for now. The final terms of the truce were largely agreed upon when the war ended, but some room for negotiation still remains. We know that the current rulers are interested in weakening the position of the Orangists, a faction within the republic seeking to grant power to a house of nobles.\n\nIf we were to put forward a suggestion for an Act to keep the next Prince of Orange away from political power, it could serve both to improve our diplomacy with the current administration and ensure that there won't be a king on their throne to lead them into another war against us."

 dutch_republic.11.b: "We have no reason to support the current administration."
 dutch_republic.12.t: "Act of Seclusion"
 dutch_republic.12.d: "The war with [From.GetName] was over, we thought all matters were settled. Negotiations have drawn out over some minor issues, but everything changed this week, when [From.GetAdjective] representatives suggested a new clause. To our surprise, one favorable to the republic.\n\nTo weaken the Orange family's position politically, they want us to pass an Act to keep future Princes of Orange from the office of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. What motive they have for this is not yet clear, but even if such an Act may not last forever, it would considerably strengthen the Statist rule... if this is handled with discretion."

 dutch_republic.12.b: "It's unthinkable that we'd accept such a demand from our enemies!"

Even so, the more fluid the rulership, the less tangible these ties become.\n\nNations who are normally pleased with the Statist administration now worry about the prospect that their ties to the [Root.GetAdjective] powers may be weakening as the nation leaves its hereditary traditions behind. They want to make sure influential families retain some power... including the Orange family."

 dutch_republic.14.t: "Nobility Ties in the Army"
 dutch_republic.14.da: "The Statist rulers have succeeded in making institutions of [Root.GetName] increasingly representative, but one institution that has resisted recent changes is the army. One of our generals belongs to a family of nobles who have strong ties to the House of Orange and has been sabotaging our efforts to oust the Orange loyalists from high-ranking military positions.\n\nNow, he's gone even further and wants one of his relatives, also an Orangist, to act as advisor to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].

 dutch_republic.15.da: "Belief in the virtue of hereditary power tends to be strong among those who have themselves inherited their power. Local nobles in [Root.GetName] don't see that connection and argue that their wish to see the House of Orange in power is grounded in their concern for national unity and stability.\n\nGoverning those who don't believe in what we are trying to achieve is not easy.

 dutch_republic.16.d: "The Statist rule has strengthened recently, which we can only interpret as a sign that the republic is the future. The successes of [Root.GetName], the increased trade economy and qualified administration, could only have happened to a federation of provinces like ours.\n\nBy giving up some of the dictatorial control the kings of old insisted on, we have achieved things that would have been impossible for them.

A country with a weak monarch may be regarded as easy prey and unworthy of respect. What does this mean for a country lacking a monarch altogether?\n\nThe Orangists claim to have the answer. For our nation to be a contender on the international arena, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] must show [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ability to unite and rule. Vain power displays are normally considered a waste, but perhaps one would be necessary now."

When the representatives can't come to an agreement, our nation can't be governed.

 dutch_republic.26.t: "Interest of [Root.GetName]"
 dutch_republic.26.d: "[Root.GetName] has been a key point for merchants and international trade for as long as anyone can remember, but the key to this success has been a point of contention. Recently, an economic theorist from the area has argued, in his work 'Interest of [Root.GetName] and the motives for its prosperity', that the republican government form is part of the reason the province has thrived, suggesting that with the right political environment, this good fortune could spread throughout [Root.Owner.GetName]."
 dutch_republic.26.a: "A sensible conclusion."
 dutch_republic.26.b: "Their interests aren't necessarily those of other [Root.Owner.GetAdjective]."
 dutch_republic.27.t: "Concerns from our Border"
 dutch_republic.27.d: "Some in our nation's frontier provinces look across the border with pride or ambitions of conquest. Others with fear. Bordering a nation which may threaten our sovereignty has led some influential local leaders to support Statist agendas in the [Root.GovernmentName], hoping to avoid a Prince leading the nation who may seek to expand the [Root.GetAdjective] borders and cause unnecessary conflict with our stronger neighbor."

 dutch_republic.28.da: "Being a border province does not seem to be a cause for concern among the nobles of [Root.GetName]. Conversely, they believe that our neighbors should be the ones to be concerned, as we might very well decide that their lands would be better off under the rule of [Root.GetName] or as Generality Lands of the republic. The people across the border seem to have seen this coming, since they appear to fear the might of [Root.Owner.GetName], particularly with an ambitious Prince of Orange in power."

 dutch_republic.28.b: "Our nation is just as powerful, if in other ways, when ruled by others."
 dutch_republic.29.t: "The Plans of [Root.GetName]"
 dutch_republic.29.d: "Having to share a border with a nation we have declared open rivalry and hostility against could lead people to be contemptuous, but the good citizens of [Root.GetCapitalName] have managed to hide their contempt well.\n\nInstead, the local nobles have secretly started to draft plans of expansion into the lands of our enemy, plans that they believe might be put into action if [Root.Owner.GetName] would only have a leader who thought of the nation's glory first and political games second. They have little respect for the efforts of republicans, but believe that the Prince might support their ambitions."
 dutch_republic.29.a: "He just might."
 dutch_republic.29.b: "War is the concern of the States-General, not of local nobles."
 dutch_republic.30.t: "Debate in [Root.GetCapitalName]"

 republic_factions.1.d: "The trade of [Root.GetTradeGoodsName] in [Root.Owner.GetName] has sparked conflict in [Root.GetName]. Merchants who want free reins to buy and sells these goods believe the guild controlling its manufacture have grown too powerful. In their eyes, it is now nothing but a cartel causing harm to the economy.\n\nThe guild leaders, on the other hand, argue that their organization is making the production of [Root.GetTradeGoodsName] more efficient. Whichever side we come down on, those who oppose our policies are likely to suffer, or even sabotage their own activities to make a point."

 republic_factions.1.b: "A strong guild is necessary to ensure quality."
 republic_factions.2.t: "Guilds Push for Mercantilist Reforms"

They are, of course, highly knowledgeable in these matters... and also, coincidentally, likely to benefit from the policies they are backing.\n\nOthers are not as likely to benefit. Powerful traders operating internationally claim that these theories constitute a dead end, and will fight tooth and nail to prevent the republic from adopting them. With the support of the guilds, it may be possible, but not without political upheaval."

 republic_factions.2.b: "Mercantilism is the future, whether traders know it or not."
 republic_factions.3.t: "Merchants Call for Increased Imports"
 republic_factions.3.d: "The influence of a powerful guild has driven up prices on [Root.GetTradeGoodsName] in [Root.Owner.GetName]. It has come to the point where traders are finding it cheaper to import goods from abroad to compete with local prices, something they claim is becoming more difficult due to the current [Root.Owner.GetAdjective] legislation on imports.\n\nRelaxing customs would give our merchants a chance to make beneficial agreements where [Root.GetTradeGoodsName] is produced, but the guilds, who are vehemently opposed to this, do serve their purpose as well."
 republic_factions.3.a: "Our concern must be efficient trade first and foremost."
 republic_factions.3.b: "We will make no concessions that may harm the guilds."
 republic_factions.4.t: "Guild Leaders Rival Nobles' Status"
 republic_factions.4.d: "In [Root.GetName], the presence of guilds has bred a new sort of influence, and a new sort of influential person. Leading figures in the guild of [Root.GetCapitalName] are not only growing richer than many aristocrats in the province, they also wield power, all while lacking the familial ties that have defined the rulers of the city for a long time.\n\nPerhaps this sort of shift is inevitable, especially considering the nature of our republic. Nevertheless, at this stage, the only thing that's certain is that the nobles in [Root.GetName] have an aversion to these ill-mannered new rich and would like to see them ousted from local political proceedings."
 republic_factions.4.a: "Money is money, new or old."
 republic_factions.4.b: "If they do us a few favors, we can keep the upstarts out."
 republic_factions.5.t: "Secret Societies in Government"
 republic_factions.5.d: "The full extent of a guild's activity is really only known to members. Since guilds exist in part to manage knowledge, this is inevitable, but also leads to allegations of conspiracies. You have paid little attention to these ideas, considering them paranoid delu-\n\n'[Root.Monarch.GetTitle], our republic is in danger! We cannot speak here.'\nA noble drags you to the side and talks in a whispered voice at length of who may or may not be part of secret guilds within the government of [Root.GetName]. He names other nobles who are equally concerned... so many, in fact, that his own side seems more like a conspiracy than the ones he accuses. Even so, there is no doubt that the aristocrats of [Root.GetName] feel threatened by these possible secret societies the guilds have brought into existence."
 republic_factions.5.a: "Who cares? Maybe these conspiracies can make politicians agree for once."
 republic_factions.5.a.tt: "Leave the possible secret guild influences unaddressed for now."
 republic_factions.5.b: "Fine. Let those known to be loyal investigate this."
 republic_factions.6.t: "Guild Before Country"
 republic_factions.6.d: "When aristocrats warned us of the secret societies that had supposedly infiltrated [Root.GetAdjective] politics, we chose not to listen. They predicted that we might very well pay with our lives, when this conspiracy turned against us.\n\nNothing quite so dramatic has happened, but one of our close advisors has made some very dubious decisions lately, and eventually admitted these were services to a 'secret' society that the advisor was indeed part of. Other politicians are up in arms about this, and there is no avoiding a scandal at this stage."
 republic_factions.6.a: "Their disloyalty to [Root.GetName] must be punished."
 republic_factions.6.b: "Try to defuse the situation."
 republic_factions.7.t: "International Guild Contacts"
 republic_factions.7.d: "One of our diplomatic envoys with strong connections to a domestic guild has been accused by some older ambassadors of cutting deals with a guild across the border. While he admits to attending to guild business while abroad, he denies accusations of compromising his political missions. On the other hand he says he is open to the idea of attempting to use his connections abroad to our advantage.\n\nThe old guard of aristocratic diplomats find this practice highly dubious, but leveraging connections between guilds could give us an edge in clandestine operations."
 republic_factions.7.a: "We'll see whose guild members show the most loyalty to their country."
 republic_factions.7.b: "Suspend their service until we have straightened things out."
 republic_factions.8.t: "Noble Legacy of [Root.GetName]"
 republic_factions.8.d: "Our republican nation has given up many of the old ideas about nobility and feudal rule, but sometimes, when they are of use to us, we are willing to reconsider them on a situational basis. Such a situation has arisen in [Root.GetName], where a local aristocrat claims that land just across our border is in fact part of his family's rightful demesne.\n\nLocal merchants have petitioned against this claim, having just negotiated a major trade deal with the neighboring nation. For a republic, they argue, trade should be the first concern - the claims of nobles lead only to war and misery."
 republic_factions.8.a: "War perhaps, but who said anything about misery?"
 republic_factions.8.b: "They are right. We should put these petty squabbles behind us."
 republic_factions.9.t: "Candidates Vie for Opportunities"
 republic_factions.9.d: "As a republic, we strive to strike a balance between economic interests and tradition. We choose our advisors accordingly. Families who know this, patricians and aristocrats alike, try to plan ahead and get their representatives into positions of opportunity before they seek to advise the [Root.Monarch.GetName] directly.\n\nA position offering such opportunities recently opened, and now different parties are pressuring us for it. There can be no pleasing everyone, and someone has to be appointed soon."
 republic_factions.9.a: "Someone experienced in military matters would be of use."
 republic_factions.9.b: "Commerce comes first in [Root.GetName]."
 republic_factions.10.t: "Trade between Rivals"
 republic_factions.10.d: "We are open to business with everyone... as long as we can control it. What business we can and cannot control is open to debate, and as most question open to debate in our republic, it has become subject to it. Merchants have started trading on friendly terms with one of our rivals, claiming it's necessary despite political disagreements. Aristocrats find this questionable and call for an immediate end to the exchanges."
 republic_factions.10.a: "We can afford to cut ties with these swine."
 republic_factions.10.b: "We cannot afford to cut ties with these swine."
 republic_factions.10.b.tt: "[This.GetName] will gain power in one of the nodes we trade in."
 republic_factions.11.t: "[From.GetName] Opens for Trade"
 republic_factions.11.d: "Despite their open hatred of us and everything we stand for, the [From.GetAdjective] have allowed their traders the opportunity to make deals with us. This has granted us a chance to wield some power where they would normally oust our merchants."
 republic_factions.11.a: "They should trust us with this more often."
 republic_factions.12.t: "Offer from $ARTIST$"
 republic_factions.12.d: "The guilds of [Root.GetName] have outmaneuvered their competitors in the political arena, wresting control over the [Root.GetAdjective] government, but their power is far from uncontested.\n\n$ARTIST$, valued by the republic for his unparalleled skill as a craftsman and artist, approaches you with a solution to this problem.\n'[Root.Monarch.GetTitle],' $ARTIST$ says, 'a shift in power now may undo everything the guilds have wisely worked towards. We know you are a wise [Root.Monarch.GetWomanMan], but if you need an additional incentive, the guilds do not lack funds for political donations...'"
 republic_factions.12.a: "Do you not think I recognize a bribe when I see one?"
 republic_factions.12.b: "A donation used to fund public projects seems perfectly innocent."
 republic_factions.13.t: "Offer from $TRADER$"
 republic_factions.13.d: "'We're losing ground, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle],' $TRADER$ claims in a private conversation after a recent political debate. 'Our republic depends on trade. It is at the very core of our sovereignty. If we put other interests ahead of those of the merchants, we will soon find ourselves ruled not by a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], but by confused minds who will abandon what has brought us to greatness.'\n\nYou know all too well what comes next. Promises of the wealth the continued rule of the traders will bring to [Root.GetName]... and much more tangible promises of what wealth it will bring to you."
 republic_factions.13.a: "What this republic needs least of all is corruption."
 republic_factions.13.b: "What you are saying is true. [Root.GetName] needs money."
 republic_factions.14.t: "Offer from $COMMANDANT$"
 republic_factions.14.d: "In many other nations, aristocrats enjoy much greater power than here. In [Root.GetName], money is what matters, not rank. $COMMANDANT$, a person lacking neither, is well aware of this.\n\n'Ultimately,' they say, 'if [Root.GetName] is to flourish, it needs a strong ruler. The military is standing by you, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], if you would be willing to restore some of its old glory. Many among the nobility would be willing to back such a cause with considerable funds.'"
 republic_factions.14.a: "The republic cannot be bought!"
 republic_factions.14.b: "Your loyalty is highly appreciated."
 republic_factions.15.t: "The Inner Circle"
 republic_factions.15.d: "You have tried to maintain a relative neutrality as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to guilds, especially since they have somewhat fallen out of favor in [Root.GetName]. You are not the member of any guild, nor would it in the current political climate be appropriate for you to be. Yet that situation may change. The republic's most prominent guild has offered you membership, even promising to maintain secrecy regarding this as long as needed. Quite a bold suggestion, although refusing would still put you on bad terms with the guild."
 republic_factions.15.a: "I can't swear loyalty to anything but the republic."
 republic_factions.15.b: "I can keep a secret if they can."
 republic_factions.16.t: "A Beneficial Transaction"
 republic_factions.16.d: "In [Root.GetName], business and politics have been irreversibly intertwined since time immemorial. Sometimes, we may be faced with deals that benefit many parties but not the republic itself. When the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] is one of those parties, the situation becomes all the more precarious.\n\nA good business agreement builds stronger relations with key merchants, something we could certainly use. We can avoid alienating these partners if we are willing to sacrifice some of our integrity as a representative of the republic."
 republic_factions.16.a: "Integrity is worth more in the long run."
 republic_factions.16.b: "We cannot be expected to go against our own interests for the sake of [Root.GetName]."
 republic_factions.17.t: "Thicker Than Water"
 republic_factions.17.d: "To many powerful people in [Root.GetName], contacts or wealth determine status, but nobles still value blood ties highly. Even though the nobles are far from the most powerful faction in our republic at this time, they still use the same methods to ensure loyalty. \n\nA recent request for the hand of your daughter from a well-known aristocratic family is clearly such an attempt. You know that this will force you to steer politics closer to their line and weaken the republic, but refusing will make it even more difficult to compel them to support your planned military reforms."
 republic_factions.17.a: "Decline as politely as possible."
 republic_factions.17.b: "We need to maintain close ties to this family."
 republic_factions.18.t: "Guilds in Cooperation"
 republic_factions.18.d: "Since the guilds came to become the dominant power not only in [Root.GetAdjective] business, but also in politics, the guilds have increasingly seen the strength in cooperation. Organizations that may otherwise have seen each other as rivals are now operating efficiently together to maintain power in governing the nation and as a fortunate side effect, their control over the quality and trade of [Root.GetAdjective] goods has grown less narrow and more broad and efficient."
 republic_factions.18.a: "If only they could be this reasonable when they're not as fortunate..."
 republic_factions.19.t: "Traders Look Abroad"
 republic_factions.19.d: "Having wrested control over the [Root.GetAdjective] republic, our merchants are now looking to wrest control over trade worldwide. Their domination of political matters in [Root.GetName] has given them less to worry about domestically and emboldened them to take risks that would be unthinkable if they had to worry about being overruled at home. Ultimately, this may benefit not just them, but the republic itself."
 republic_factions.19.a: "Let them bring the wealth of the world to us."
 republic_factions.20.t: "Aristocrats Put Differences Aside"
 republic_factions.20.d: "Since [Root.GetName] began to serve the aristocrats, the aristocrats have begun to serve [Root.GetName]. Once afraid that they were seen as a relic of old government forms, the nobles have realized that they can maintain power as long as they are willing to work together. While this may put them at odds with other [Root.GetAdjective] political forces, it has served to put ambitions of overthrowing the republic at rest and helped them organizing their efforts much more efficiently."
 republic_factions.20.a: "Our great republic unites even the old families!"
 republic_factions.21.t: "Guilds Obstruct Trade"
 republic_factions.21.d: "Guild leaders can be ruthless power brokers and don't take kindly to being opposed politically. Since the guilds haven't controlled the government of [Root.Owner.GetName] for some time, some of them have started to use more intimidating methods to show their influence. Knowing that the republic depends on trade, the guild controlling [Root.GetTradeGoodsName] have begun to prevent it from being freely traded, knowingly harming the national economy and the affairs of their political opponents."
 republic_factions.21.a: "Do they think they'll gain the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]'s favor this way?"
 republic_factions.22.t: "Trader Refuses to Serve Republic"
 republic_factions.22.d: "Despite [Root.GetName]'s unquestionable devotion to trade, many of its most prominent traders are now claiming that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] refuses to listen to them and are putting other interests ahead of those which have made our country rich. One of the merchants we rely on for our international trade has threatened to cease working with the republic altogether. Although we are sure to come to an agreement eventually, this will hamper our cooperation before it blows over."
 republic_factions.22.a: "What does he plan to accomplish with this?"
 republic_factions.23.t: "Aristocrats Reject Republic"
 republic_factions.23.d: "In many ways, our republic has been remarkably efficient in removing power from the aristocratic rulers who normally take it for granted. They accept that they cannot claim it as their right, as they could in many other nations. There are times when these old ideas of aristocratic glory reawaken, however, as the nobles of [Root.GetName] feel like they cannot impact its politics in any relevant way but by the sword. Accordingly, the sword is what they have taken up, in open rebellion against the republic."
 republic_factions.23.a: "If they want power, teach them to fight with the pen instead!"
 republic_factions.24.t: "The Family Act"
 republic_factions.24.d: "The aristocrats of [Root.GetName] have been pushing for a legislation popularly referred to as the Family Act, an effort to prevent innocent minds from the twisted plays and novels spewed forth by 'libertine' authors of recent years. The main outrage behind the initiative for the Family Act is an obscene play, a family act, travelling the country which satirizes the excesses of the aristocratic classes. Humiliated and revolted, the victims of its mockery are now demanding that the republic prevents it from spreading further."
 republic_factions.24.a: "Interesting. What do they call an act like that?"
 republic_factions.24.b: "Liberty does not exist to serve obscenities!"
 republic_factions.101.t: "Revolution in $COUNTRY$"
 republic_factions.101.d: "For some time now, the Republic has seen an increased control of the Guilds on the [Root.GetAdjective] political stage. Relying on a large number of apprentices, small shop owners and craftsmen, this faction has been able to confiscate all power within the government, and to monopolize all offices in the administration.\n\nRather than risk lasting marginalization the Aristocrats and Traders have begun to speculate in grain. This has quickly drained the state reserves of bread and grain and lead to a severe increase in prices. Until now, the Guilds have disregarded the developing crisis, as poor people requesting loans to buy food seemed to be an opportunity for tidy profits. That is until they began to crowd the Main Plaza of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], at the foot of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s palace, going as far as slaughtering half a score guards that had ordered them to disperse.\n\nWorst of all, they have begun to loot dozens shops!"
 republic_factions.101.a: "We cannot allow the masses to engulf the Republic in anarchy."
 republic_factions.101.b: "Give in to their demands."
 republic_factions.102.t: "Revolution in $COUNTRY$"
 republic_factions.102.d: "By sampling the riches of far-away countries and selling them on the markets in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], the [Root.GetAdjective] Traders have managed to progressively impose themselves on the Parliament. This done, it was easy to take control of all offices that could assure their power over the Republic. And who would hold this against them? Never has [Root.GetName] been so flourishing, and the gold is pouring in as never before.\n\nYes, who? Squires, maybe, seeing their houses threatened with ruin as their estates are bought by the men in power? Presumably the Guilds also, as Traders favor profits on import more than protection of the home-made products. Maybe commoners also, growing tired of price increases on market stalls and of seeing rents double, for the greater benefit of Traders always eager to increase their wealth…\n\nIn the morning, upset crowds gather at the gates of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s palace, ready to batter them down."
 republic_factions.102.a: "Let us not be intimidated by a bunch of scoundrels!"
 republic_factions.102.b: "Give in to their demands."
 republic_factions.103.t: "Revolution in $COUNTRY$"
 republic_factions.103.d: "Using every means of pressure available, the nobility of [Root.GetName] has managed to seize control of power in our Republic. The sons of powerful aristocratic families parade in the streets, as well as in the palaces of the Republic. At this point their rivals could never hope to find a legal way to re-establish the influence that they have lost.\n\nA legal way? Last night, a young noble was killed during a sordid fight in a tavern. The murderer is a widely known noble himself, the first son of his family. As the authorities intervene, however, the one who stands accused of this crime is someone else entirely, coincidentally the son of a master weaver who is also a prominent spokesman for the Guilds.\n\nNext morning, Guilds and Traders have begun distributing bread and weapons to the commoners; the upset crowds rally around the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s palace, and a first charge by the urban militia has caused great loss of blood and lives, before the mob could violently avenge itself. [Root.Monarch.GetName] is under siege."

 elective_monarchy.6.d: "While our nation naturally belongs to the true [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, we are backing a member of our dynasty to succeed to the throne in a country that follows a misguided heretical faith. That country has now placed a demand on our candidate to convert to their religion if he is to be allowed to take the throne."
 elective_monarchy.6.a: "Accept these outrageous demands"
 elective_monarchy.6.b: "We will not imperil his soul!"
 elective_monarchy.7.t: "Suspicious Accident"
 elective_monarchy.7.d: "Our candidate for the throne of $FROM$ has passed away in what appears to be a hunting accident. Though we suspect the accident was in fact a cunning assassination carried out by backers of a different candidate, we have no proof and all our hard work to place our dynasty on the $FROM_ADJ$ throne is undone."
 elective_monarchy.7.a: "Awful!"
 elective_monarchy.8.t: "The Blood of [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] Unites"
 elective_monarchy.8.d: "Although [Root.GetName] is sometimes weakened by the external influence on our politics, electing a monarch from another nation has created a bond of trust and allowed for unique diplomatic opportunities. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has made excellent use of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] family's influence abroad and strengthened ties to the place our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] once called home."
 elective_monarchy.8.a: "Let us hope they last."
 elective_monarchy.9.t: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] Inherits Title"
 elective_monarchy.9.d: "Although [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] first and foremost, [Root.Monarch.GetName] still has the right to some titles in the land from which [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] hails. While foreigners might have supported [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ascent to the throne with hopes of ruling over us, having a rightful claim on a title in their lands may well give us a chance to do the reverse..."
 elective_monarchy.9.a: "It is [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] birthright!"
 elective_monarchy.9.b: "We have no ulterior motives with our choice."
 elective_monarchy.10.t: "Sejm Forces Abdication"
 elective_monarchy.10.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] knows that [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] time may soon come. Wishing to secure the title for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] dynasty, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has begun to seek support for selecting one of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] progeny as next in line, questioning the choice of the Sejm. The nobles have not taken kindly to this and are considering forcing the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to abdicate in favor of the heir they have already chosen for the throne."
 elective_monarchy.10.a: "Absolutely. Absolutism must be avoided."
 elective_monarchy.10.b: "Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] can't bow so easily to nobles!"
 elective_monarchy.11.t: "The [Root.Religion.GetName] Convert"
 elective_monarchy.11.d: "The world is seeing turbulent religious change. A monarch shifting religious allegiance can be seen as a powerful trend, and when [Root.Monarch.GetName] turned to the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith on ascending to the throne, many took note. If the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] could convert, what is stopping the other unenlightened from seeing the truth? Nothing, its supporters argue. The pressure on everyone, noble or commoner, who has not yet fallen into line is now higher than ever."
 elective_monarchy.11.a: "Let us hope they see reason, or at least faith."
 elective_monarchy.12.t: "Overambitious Campaign"
 elective_monarchy.12.d: "The aggressive war [Root.Monarch.GetName] has undertaken is not progressing well. This is always a cause for unrest, but particularly so when the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] is a foreigner. Over the course of the war, people have started to claim that [Root.GetName] is a peaceful nation and that this foolhardy monarch is bringing it to ruin."
 elective_monarchy.12.a: "The war has only begun! Onward!"
 elective_monarchy.12.b: "We must try to end the conflict quickly."
 elective_monarchy.13.t: "Like Home"
 elective_monarchy.13.d: "Being of [Root.Culture.GetName] birth, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] often visits [Root.GetName]. Not only does the province serve as a reminder to the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] of [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] past, but the people there who normally feel somewhat estranged from their [Root.Owner.GetAdjective] rulers are glad to see that the Sejm approved a monarch who speaks their language. A recent visit has considerably improved the locals' impression of the administration."
 elective_monarchy.13.a: "There was no reason to ever doubt it."
 elective_monarchy.14.t: "Loyalties of [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Heir.GetName]"
 elective_monarchy.14.d: "Electing monarchs from different nations allows us, to some extent, to avoid a dynasty taking control over [Root.GetName] entirely, but also causes foreign nobles to sometimes doubt our loyalty. The [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family to which our current [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] belongs has noticed that the increased support in the Sejm for [Root.Heir.GetName] of the [Root.Heir.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty. Although they hopefully understand that they can't rule our nation forever, they are beginning to ask questions about how this will affect future cooperation between us."
 elective_monarchy.14.a: "Assure them that the Sejm stays loyal to the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] line."
 elective_monarchy.14.b: "Admit that a shift is necessary."
 elective_monarchy.14.c: "Stay neutral. The Sejm owes allegiance only to [Root.GetName]."
 elective_monarchy.15.t: "[From.GetAdjective] Sejm Shifts Allegiance"
 elective_monarchy.15.d: "After a noble of the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family ascended to the [From.GetAdjective] throne, we were hoping to see a long-time rule there by our dynasty. However, the Sejm's support of another foreign heir has strained the relationship between our nations. When pressured, [From.GetName] has made it clear that the times are changing, and that they are trying to avoid another monarch from [Root.GetName]."
 elective_monarchy.15.a: "Fickle [From.GetAdjective] nobles!"
 elective_monarchy.16.t: "[From.GetAdjective] Sejm Turns to Us"
 elective_monarchy.16.d: "[From.GetName] has been under pressure from the [From.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] to maintain the bloodline's hold of their throne, but the Sejm has spoken against them, in our favor. [From.Heir.GetName], already having popular support in the Sejm, is now considered their primary candidate for escaping the dynasty's grip and avoiding an absolutist monarch."
 elective_monarchy.16.a: "[From.Heir.GetSheHeCap] will lead them to freedom... or at least to us."
 elective_monarchy.17.t: "Golden Liberty"
 elective_monarchy.17.d: "Ruling in [Root.GetName] is not like ruling in other nations. Dictating the nation's goals is difficult without approval from nobles, sometimes impossible. To a foreign monarch, this may seem disappointing and frustrating, but this cornerstone of [Root.GetAdjective] politics is highly valued in its homeland and is, in fact, what [Root.Monarch.GetName] has to thank for coming into power in the first place. Embracing these ideas might make the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] seem weak internationally, but would aid in integrating better and gaining supporters in the Sejm."
 elective_monarchy.17.a: "They were wise to elect us. Let us listen to them."
 elective_monarchy.17.b: "We must wrest control of this anarchy!"
 elective_monarchy.18.t: "[Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] Family Gains Claim on [Root.GetAdjective] Throne"
 elective_monarchy.18.d: "Recent power shifts among the foreign relatives of [Root.Monarch.GetName] and clashing inheritance laws have led to an unfortunate situation with the house of [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName]. A member of the dynasty has now been suggested to be the rightful ruler of not only [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s homeland, but ours as well.\n\nWhether or not this claim will be pushed through war or is merely used to bolster the foreign monarch's status for a domestic power struggle remains to be seen. Regardless, the possibility of being forced into a union in this manner is ominous."
 elective_monarchy.18.a: "We elected one of theirs as a show of good faith!"
 elective_monarchy.19.t: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] Gains Claim on [From.GetAdjective] Throne"
 elective_monarchy.19.d: "Our support for [From.Monarch.GetName], our candidate for the [From.GetAdjective] throne, has yielded us many diplomatic advantages since [From.Monarch.GetSheHe] was elected. Recently, however, it has been suggested that the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family's claims on [From.GetName] reaches beyond this single individual and that [Root.Monarch.GetName] should in fact be considered the ruler of both [Root.GetName] and [From.GetName].\n\n[From.Monarch.GetName] considers [From.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] sovereign, of course, but [Root.Monarch.GetName] outranks [From.Monarch.GetHerHim] in the dynasty. Surely a [From.Monarch.GetTitle]'s first loyalty must be to family, must it not?"
 elective_monarchy.19.a: "An intriguing line of thought..."
 republican_dictatorship.1.t: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Takes Control of Administration"
 republican_dictatorship.1.d: "In [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s eyes, rapid, unquestioned decision-making is the only way to ensure [Root.GetName] makes the reforms necessary to keep up with the times. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] impatience with the political processes involved has annoyed some senior officials, who claim that previous rulers took more measured steps towards enforcing their ideas. They fear that this aggressive pursuit of ends without considering the means may have grave consequences for our nation in the long run."
 republican_dictatorship.1.a: "[Root.GetName] is not a democracy, and they should get used to it."
 republican_dictatorship.1.b: "We should consider their concerns."
 republican_dictatorship.2.t: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Takes Control of Foreign Affairs"
 republican_dictatorship.2.d: "[Root.GetAdjective] policies on international trade and diplomacy have been distinguished by tact and caution, but in the eyes of [Root.Monarch.GetName], not sufficient progress. With absolute rulership, there should not be any need for hesitation.\n\nIn practice, however, there may be good reason to hesitate. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] might see a clear path ahead of us, but it is a path cut out in a world of monarchs and despots. Even with autocratic ruler at the helm today, is this truly the future we want for our nation?"
 republican_dictatorship.2.a: "It is, and we shall reach it first!"
 republican_dictatorship.2.b: "Let us consider our options."
 republican_dictatorship.3.t: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Takes Control of the Military"
 republican_dictatorship.3.d: "If [Root.Monarch.GetName] is to shape the future of our [Root.GetName], [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] must be able to wield its armies as a weapon against a hostile world. But the military, although respectful of the order of command and an ambitious ruler, also has traditions and structures that cannot be broken down without eroding the idea that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is operating with popular support. Will [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] legacy be that of just another first in a line of monarchs?"
 republican_dictatorship.3.a: "Whatever works."
 republican_dictatorship.3.b: "No. We will stop and listen."
 republican_dictatorship.4.t: "Supporter for [Root.Monarch.GetName] in the Military"
 republican_dictatorship.4.d: "While many within the military still retain some loyalty to the previous administration, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] does enjoy some very ardent supporters. Some army leaders value the absolute power [Root.Monarch.GetName] wields and see the need for a leader with authority in these turbulent times.\n\nPromoting even a talented individual for obvious political reasons may not be well received, but we need our generals to be both skilled and loyal. Should we seize this opportunity or nobly keep our distance?"
 republican_dictatorship.4.a: "Nothing can be questionable about rewarding expertise."
 republican_dictatorship.4.b: "Better leave such matters to experienced military leaders."
 republican_dictatorship.5.t: "The People Demand Democracy"
 republican_dictatorship.5.d: "'We have abandoned kings! Let us abandon despots!'\n\nThe people, having seen the old institutions overthrown, are beginning to view [Root.Monarch.GetName] as another absolutist monarch hiding behind the veneer of modern government. They demand real, tangible changes and representation if they are to tolerate [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] continued reign. Perhaps they will be more inclined to accept a ruler for life if we make concessions... lest they cut that life short."
 republican_dictatorship.5.a: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] is a [Root.Monarch.GetWomanMan] of the people!"
 republican_dictatorship.5.b: "[Root.GetName] was never meant to be a democracy."
 republican_dictatorship.6.t: "Increase Delegation in Government"
 republican_dictatorship.6.d: "Administrative matters have never been [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s strong suit. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] can make decisions, but many of the finer points of politics escape [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. Employing subordinates to handle these matters has somewhat mitigated the problem, but has also led them to grow bolder, requesting more control over administrative matters. While this is clearly a bid to weaken central leadership, insisting on retaining control would put us in direct conflict with competent individuals."
 republican_dictatorship.6.a: "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] need not dictate everything."
 republican_dictatorship.6.b: "Get rid of anyone who would suggest such a thing."
 republican_dictatorship.7.t: "Increase Delegation in Foreign Affairs"
 republican_dictatorship.7.d: "A [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] does not rule by compromise, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] is no exception. Sadly, in international diplomacy, compromise is sometimes necessary. Having a ruler who fails to navigate sensitive diplomatic situations has made ambassadors and diplomats inclined to attempt having decisions delegated to them and others. Normally, we would never accept even such a subtle defiance of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s power, but [Root.GetName] seems to have benefited from it."
 republican_dictatorship.7.a: "Then let us compromise, just this once."
 republican_dictatorship.7.b: "This cannot be allowed to continue."
 republican_dictatorship.8.t: "Increase Delegation in the Military"
 republican_dictatorship.8.d: "The army can be quite resistant to change, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] is not very well versed in military matters. Fortunately, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] employs people who are, and they have begun to quite appreciate their superior's lack of directions. Army leadership is now requesting more and more freedom in which decisions to make, and while this seemed like a good idea initially, losing control over our nation's military would be a serious blow to the office of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 republican_dictatorship.8.a: "Let us focus on ruling [Root.GetName] and let others handle defending it."
 republican_dictatorship.8.b: "We must seize control again!"
 republican_dictatorship.9.t: "Relative Fails Local Rule"
 republican_dictatorship.9.d: "Having taken care to appoint trustworthy people to important positions, we have coincidentally ended up with many of the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]'s close relatives as local rulers. While this affords us more control over how our policies are implemented in the nation, the people of [Root.GetCapitalName] are claiming to suffer under an incompetent mayor. In their eyes, [Root.Owner.GetName] is returning to a time when power was determined by family ties, and they are paying the price."
 republican_dictatorship.9.a: "The people have spoken. The Mayor should resign."
 republican_dictatorship.9.b: "These allegations are nonsense."
 republican_dictatorship.10.t: "Local Military Doubts Administration"
 republican_dictatorship.10.d: "While adherence to some republican principles has allowed the reign of [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] to be accepted by many, some leaders in the army consider this a sign of weakness. A general in [Root.GetName] have begun to conspire against the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle], claiming that the nation lacks a leader with the authority to maintain control into the next generation. According to them, [Root.Owner.GetName] risks turning to anarchy or populist rule over time if nothing is done."
 republican_dictatorship.10.a: "Then I shall be the one to do it!"
