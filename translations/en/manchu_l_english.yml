The man tasked with defending the Shanghai Pass is Wu Sangui, a talented and ambitious commander who has faced [Root.Culture.GetName] armies in battle before with some success. Recent events in the capital and beyond have shaken his loyalty to the Ming [MNG.Monarch.GetTitle], and now he seeks an unlikely alliance with his former enemies. Promised titles and offices under the new order, Wu Sangui has agreed to defect to [Root.GetName]. We can march safely through the Shanghai Pass and onwards toward a weakened Beijing."

Rather than submitting to the [726.Owner.GetName] pretenders, Wu has become enraged and pledged his loyalty to [Root.GetName] in defiance. The gates of the Shanghai Pass are open to us.

Not only are they taxed far beyond their capacity to pay and still support themselves, but if they flee the land to escape tax obligations, these are transferred to their kin who remain behind, leading to even greater tax burdens. What is more, the yangban elite have increasingly been acquiring land for themselves, pushing out the rural poor. This has led to a general climate of lawlessness and unrest among the peasantry that, if left unchecked, could pose a significant threat to the state."

 string_start_korea: "The §YJoseon Kingdom of Korea§!, officially the §YKingdom of Great Joseon§!, emerged from the ashes of §YMongol§! and §YMing§! invasions via a coup d'état by General §YYi Seonggye§! (later known as §YKing Taejo§!) in 1392. From the start, Joseon Korea's connection to §YMing China§! was strong: When settling on a name for the new kingdom, Taejo submitted the options 'Hwaryeong' and 'Joseon' to Ming and decided on the latter after its endorsement by the Emperor.\n\nThis close connection to §YMing China§! was to remain until the downfall of the Ming in the mid-17th century - as was Korea's subordinate status in the relationship. As followers of §YConfucianism§!, Koreans viewed China as being at the heart of the Korean world, and Joseon Korea came to be in some ways even more sinicized than China itself - a 'little China'. For their part, the Chinese viewed Joseon Korea as the 'country of courteous people in the East'. For as long as Ming remains the undisputed claimant to the §YMandate of Heaven§!, the maintenance of these strong bonds will remain vital to the survival of the fledgling Korean kingdom.\n\nThe achievements of the first century of §YJoseon§! rule were considerable. In the early 15th century, the border regions of §YGyeongseong§! and §YYukjin§! were taken from the §YJurchens§!, allowing the Koreans to unite the territory which would form modern-day Korea. There was also a flourishing of academia and knowledge. In particular, the hangeul alphabet was introduced in 1446. Unlike the Chinese alphabet, it was designed to be both easy to learn and easy to adapt to the Korean language, making its use far more convenient and allowing a far broader section of society to read scholarly texts. Further notable progress was made in the fields of agriculture, gunpowder and the codification of the law, and major efforts were made to survey and record the geography of the land.\n\nHowever, threats to the Korean kingdom remain from both within and beyond its borders. At home, Korea's peasants remain poor, and both §Ypeasant uprisings§! and insufficient tax receipts are likely to become a problem if nothing is done to rectify the situation. Furthermore, although the upper class of §Yyangban elites§! has for the most part been united, the cracks in this façade are already beginning to show and could erupt into §Yfactional strife§! at any time.\n\nOn the foreign front lie threats aplenty. To the north await the warlike §YJurchens§! - although presently divided, should they come to be unified under a strong leader, an invasion of Korea might follow swiftly. Similarly, across the sea to the east lies §YJapan§!, a nation of warring §Ydaimyos§! and would-be §Yshoguns§!. Korea must be vigilant, lest a united Japan seek to expand its power across the narrow channel of the Korean Sea. Finally, although Korea basks in the shadow of the §YMing Empire§!, woe betide the Joseon prince who wakes the dragon!"
 string_start_jurchens: "The Han know well the dangers of allowing the §YJurchens§! to unite. In the 12th century the Jurchen warlord §YAguda§! united the Jurchens in rebellion against the §YLiao§!, founding the state of §YJin§! and crowning himself §YEmperor Taizu§!. The §YMing§! dynasty wishes to avoid another Jurchen uprising, and takes measures to ensure that they continue to fight among themselves with no faction becoming too powerful. To that end, Ming has established a loose overlordship over the §YJianzhou§! and §YHaixi§! Jurchens.\n\nOf the Jurchen tribes the Jianzhou are by far the most powerful. Like the Haixi they are a settled people; the institutions and philosophies of Chinese rule are slowly spreading into the region and being embraced by local Khans.\n\nDespite the encroachment of Chinese rule and customs, the settled Jurchens retain most of the same traditions and the warrior-culture of the ‘Wild Jurchens’ to the north. The nomadic tribes of §YYeren§!, §YUdege§!, and §YDonghai§! are far from powerless, and have to contend only with each other and the relatively isolated §YSolon§! and §YNikvh§! peoples.\n\n§YKorea§! often finds itself at odds with the Jurchens, and has only recently annexed the north-eastern provinces of §YYukjin§! and §YGyeongseong§! from a branch of the Jianzhou. Both the Jurchens and Koreans consider §YPaektu Mountain§! to be a sacred place, and each believe that they alone should have access to the holy peak.\n\nThe Jurchens and the §YMongols§! have an ever-changing relationship. Sometimes allies and sometimes bitter rivals, the tribes of both people often intermarry to secure political ties, and dynastic feuding is common. The §YKorchin§! Mongols under §YKhan Unebolad§! have become ascendent in the east and may set their sights on expanding into Jurchen land if they are not contained.\n\nThe Jurchen Khans remember the days of Jin fondly. If they are able to overcome the divisions between the tribes and keep the Mongols at bay they may yet rise again under a new leader, defeat the Ming, and forge for themselves a new identity."
