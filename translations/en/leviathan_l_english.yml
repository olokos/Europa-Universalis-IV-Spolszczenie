A potlatch is a highly complex event where we commemorate a specific event by gathering together; in them, usually the chief of the tribe would prove his own wealth by lavishly giving highly elaborate and expensive gifts to visiting people.

Such is the importance of the bison for our culture that we would feel guideless without them."
 bow_archery: "Bow Archery"

But best of all, they can be disassembled and packed away quickly, so they are perfect for when we need to relocate."

The number of mares and stallions are big among the tribes, and they have become one with us. A part of our culture forever."

[Root.Monarch.GetName] does not hesitate and follow the man through the woods until [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] finds [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] prey. A big deer, the biggest [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has ever seen poses majestic in the middle of a clearing. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] whispers a short 'thank you' to the spirits of the forest for this opportunity that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will not miss. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] orders [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] men to stay quiet and in their positions as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] starts to silently move towards the best position to fire [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] bow. The bow is ready to release the arrow destined to kill the animal. [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s breath is calm. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] fingers start to free the arrow."
 native_americans.29.d2: "A woman from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]'s tribe approaches [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] while [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is fishing as [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] tribe usually does to feed their people. [Root.Monarch.GetName] raises [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] head towards her, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] eyes meet and [Root.Monarch.GetName] knows she has seen something unusual, but good, nevertheless. With piety in her gaze, she whispers how she has seen the biggest salmon ever, a true incarnation of the spirit of the river we so deeply worship. [Root.Monarch.GetName] follows her to the spot where she saw it and after a few breaths [Root.Monarch.GetName] finally sees it. It is huge indeed. [Root.Monarch.GetName] prepares [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] tools to capture it."
 native_americans.29.d3: "As [Root.Monarch.GetName] was going back home with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] canoe after a good day of seal hunting, [Root.Monarch.GetName] saw not far away from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] position a huge seal, a true blessing from the gods, emerge from the depths of the sea. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] prepares [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] harpoon and quietly moves closer to it. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] leaves the row over [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] canoe, stand up and have the harpoon ready to be fired. The seal emerges, their gazes contact as [Root.Monarch.GetName] releases the weapon."
 native_americans.29.d4: "The hunting group is coming back home when among the group of pronghorns that comes across [Root.Monarch.GetName], the biggest antelope [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has ever seen appears. Almost as if it was a deity, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] can feel a special bright aura around it and immediately knows [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has to hunt it. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] leaves the group behind and move silently to sneak the animal. When [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is ready, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] prepares [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] weapon, hoping to not miss the chance."
 native_americans.29.d5: "The land trembles as [Root.Monarch.GetName] gets closer to the herd of bison. These animals can kill anyone with their gore attacks with ease, but they are also life for our people. Suddenly, among them, [Root.Monarch.GetName] can see a massive male that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] knows has to be [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] prey. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] prepares [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] for this unequal fight before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ancestors with a quick pray. The opportunity emerges right in front of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], and [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] tries."

 aboriginal_boomerangDESCR: "The boomerang is a traditional weapon used by both hunters and warriors in Australia. Although it is not as deadly as a spear or arrow, the boomerang is a reliable and reusable hunting tool and a deadly weapon in the hands of a skilled warrior. The reduced fatality rate of a boomerang makes it the ideal tool for battles where the aim is to take prisoners, not inflict casualties."

 TIW_yiminga_desc: "Our skin, or “Yiminga” is matrilineal and is carried down from mother to her children. It is the female dynasties which determine the fate of our children; their group, life, spirit, breath, and pulse. The female brings life and form to the child, and the male locates a spirit to bring for the unborn child. While other tribes would scorn the efforts of the females, we know it is from them that our social class and family is determined, and it is only right that they share a place in power with their male counterparts."
 TIW_dreaming_totem: "The Dreaming Totem"
 TIW_dreaming_totem_desc: "The dreaming totem of a Tiwi is a sacred animal assigned to a Tiwi by their father. A Tiwi with a totem may not kill or consume the flesh of their spirit animal; to do so would be the spiritual cannibalism. It’s an integral part of a Tiwi’s individual identity and is used as a mark of identity during dances and ceremonies."

 TIW_purrukapali_desc: "The Legend of Purrukapali tells of the tragic death of Purrukapali’s son who dried out until death under the care of his neglectful mother. Purrukapali, distressed by what had happened, picked up the dried corpse of his boy and carried him to the wise Japara who promised to restore the boy to life in time, but Purrukapali in a fit of distress and impatience engaged Japara in a great battle. Purrukapali picked up the dead body of his son and carried him into the sea, proclaiming that death should come to all creation so that all would experience the grief he feels. The site where he carried his son became a strong whirlpool that would drown anyone who came near it. Japara, who ended Purrukapali’s madness, was reincarnated into the moon and became trapped in a cycle of death and reincarnation every three days."
 TIW_marriage: "Tiwi Marriage Traditions"
 TIW_marriage_desc: "Marriage is integral for economic, social, and political advantage. Marriage is as important to our livelihood as fishing, farming, and foraging, and a Tiwi woman who is unmarried is simply idle and belligerent. Remarriage is common for our people, and often lower members of society such as low-ranking hunters would often marry the widows of more successful men. Remarriage must happen quickly, for each day a woman remains unmarried is a day of great shame."
 TIW_isolationism: "Tiwi Isolationism"
 TIW_isolationism_desc: "Our society has a long history of harsh isolationism. Outsiders have only sought to plunder and take advantage of our bountiful lands and destroy our culture and this must not be allowed to pass. Our language, lands, and culture must be preserved and if that means sacrificing our ties to outsiders then that is the way it must be."
 TIW_one_people: "One People"
 TIW_one_people_desc: "“Tiwi” in our language means “One People”. We have one language, one religion, and one people. There is only Tiwi, and anyone who forms a part of our great nation shall adopt the Tiwi way of life, and the Tiwi identity and all that that involves."

 aborig_walkabout: "Walkabout"
 aborig_walkabout_desc: "The traditional Aboriginal Walkabout is a ceremony in which an Aboriginal boy is expected to journey across the harsh Australian wilderness to a holy site such as Uluru, and it is on his journey that he transitions from boy to man. The journey can last as long as six months, and in this time, the man is expected to live out in the wilderness without any outside assistance. It is a hard passage to go through, but it ensures that only the strongest amongst us survives."
 aborig_outback: "People of the Outback"
 aborig_outback_desc: "The Outback is a harsh unforgiving place. Even today, many areas of the outback are almost completely uninhabited and venturing there is seen as a death sentence. But, nonetheless, the Aboriginals were able to survive in such harsh conditions and even make lives for themselves out there. "
 aborig_sacred: "The Sacred Lands"
 aborig_sacred_desc: "The Aboriginal religious beliefs often assign divine significance to all places in Australia. Notable landmarks and features across the continent are often described as being the resting places for the gods, or relics of ancient conflicts that took place during the Dreamtime. The Rainbow Serpent, which is often seen as a creator god, is claimed to be the bringer of rain, and when a rainbow appears in the sky, it is the rainbow serpent moving from one watering hole to another."
 aborig_dreamtime: "Dreamtime"
 aborig_dreamtime_desc: "The Dreamtime refers to the time before the creation of the universe; when all that existed were spirits and gods. Different tribes have differing explanations for what brought the world into existence from the Dreamtime, but almost all tribes in Australia believed in this time before material existence. To practice meditation or worship of gods and ancestors is often described as “Dreaming”, and tapping into the knowledge of the Dreamtime scape. This is because in the Dreamtime, one’s entire ancestry exists as one, and the knowledge of your ancestors is readily available in the Dreamtime if one is able to access it."
 aborig_music: "Musical Tradition"
 aborig_music_desc: "Aboriginal music is distinctly unique in its composition. The digeridoo is a traditional instrument used in Aboriginal music, and prior to the arrival of the colonists, Australia would be the only place one could hear the tones of this unique instrument. There are songs and compositions created by the aboriginals that are as old as 1500 years and are still played today. "

 aborig_fire_stick_farming_desc: "Australia is a harsh and unforgiving land, but we’ve learned to exploit the Bush to its maximum potential.

We are experts at navigating the small shores and natural harbors of our homeland and shall continue to survive with this coastal way of life."
 EOR_bands: "Twenty-Nine Bands"
 EOR_bands_desc: "The Eora are a collection of 29 different bands of people. The bands are united by common ancestors and families, and intermarriage between bands is common and keeps our disparate people strong and united. Administrating these major bands and uniting our nation together in this loose government style will prove useful as our tribe continues to expand and more people come to call themselves Eora."
 EOR_enduring: "Enduring Culture"
 EOR_enduring_desc: "The culture of Eora is ancient beyond any knowledge, and has endured through war, conquest, and changing times. Eora artwork and culture can exist and thrive in the smallest of our villages to the vast expansive cities of the future. As times change and people of increasing number come to join our nation, one thing shall always endure; the Eora spirit."
 EOR_protect: "Protect the Ancestral Land"
 EOR_protect_desc: "The Aboriginal people of Sydney were stoic defenders of their homeland and would resist the offenses of foreign invaders against their land, even against their own self-interest. In many wars and conflicts which have come to the shores of Australia, Eora men and women would eagerly volunteer to fight and defend their land; even during times when they were seen as second-class citizens. It’s our willingness to fight and defend the sacred land which rallies new generations constantly to our cause."
 EOR_sacred: "The Sacred Shore"
 EOR_sacred_desc: "We are the traditional custodians of this sacred land. While other tribes would abandon their homes in a heartbeat for more fertile lands, we Eora have always been here and always will be here. Our 29 nations live together in harmony around the Sydney harbor, and the co-operation of our people is what will make Eora lands the envy of the world."
 EOR_pemulwuy: "Pemulwuy"
 EOR_pemulwuy_desc: "When the colonists came to visit the Eora, they rapidly began plundering our shores of fish, emptying our land of wildlife, and polluting our waters with filth. The Eora lifestyle was coming to an end. However, brave warriors like Pemulwuy would stand against these foreign invaders and end their disruptive behavior. The ferocity and bravery displayed by Pemulwuy shall prove as an example to all, and the Eora people will fight even against impossible odds."
 EOR_berewaldal: "Berewaldal"
 EOR_berewaldal_desc: "There are people from beyond our lands; beyond even Australia itself. We know they envy the lucrative produce that Eora has to offer, and we know that one way or another they will find a way to take it from us. Perhaps it is not with violence, but with clever words that we may negotiate with these outsiders and find a solution that will be good for both of our people."

 KAU_coastal_pangkarra: "Coastal Pangkarra"
 KAU_coastal_pangkarra_desc: "Along with being autonomous and minimally governed, all Pangkarra must be granted access to the sea by birthright. Fishing and maritime trade are a vital part of the Kaurna lifestyle and any Pangkarra without coastal access is no Pangkarra at all."
 KAU_redgum_shelters: "Redgum Shelters"
 KAU_redgum_shelters_desc: "While other societies are sedentary and soft, the Kaurna people move with the passing of the seasons. In summer, the ocean overflows with fish, but in winter the rains come and the maintenance of fires in our Redgum Shelters becomes vital for our survival."
 KAU_communal_ownership: "Communal Ownership"
 KAU_communal_ownership_desc: "No individual has the right to claim ownership of that which belongs to the Kaurna people. Property belongs not to landowners or nobility, but to the tribe and the people who inhabit it. This communal ownership ensures that no man or woman is left behind, and the tribe prospers or suffers as one."
 KAU_old_tjilbruke: "Old Tjilbruke"
 KAU_old_tjilbruke_desc: "Our people share the story of Tjilbruke; a great hero of the Kaurna tribe from the time of the Dreaming. Tjilbruke brought peace to the Kaurna people with his laws and proclamations which kept our people safe. So dedicated to justice was Tjilbruke that he sentenced even his own nephew to death for breaking the sacred laws of the Kaurna."

 PLW_oyster_desc: "The Great Oyster Bay is an area on our island rich with oysters, mussels, scallops, urchins and countless other easily harvestable maritime goods. Even whales and fur seals would occasionally wander to Palawan shores and bring with them the great bounty of their meats, bone, and fur. Our island truly is a blessed land, and we have mastered the harvesting of sites like Oyster Bay for their great bounty and know how to trade them with other tribes for great profit."
 PLW_dual_identity: "Dual-Identity"
 PLW_dual_identity_desc: "The Palawa identity can be broken down into two hierarchies; the domestic unit of families, and the clan unit which would be a separate clan of 40-50 people, and both identities would exist under the hierarchy of the tribe."
 PLW_darwin: "Darwin Glass"
 PLW_darwin_desc: "Unknown centuries ago, our island was struck with a great monument from the gods which landed squarely in the centre of our island. Though it caused great destruction, it also brought with it a powerful building material ideal for crafting into spears and jewellery. Our island may well be the only site in the world to contain this precious material, and we must capitalize on this through trade and warfare."
 PLW_parlevar: "Parlevar"
 PLW_parlevar_desc: "In the beginning of time, the creators Moinee and Droemerdene set about their work crafting the world. Moinee was the architect of the world; forming land and rivers of our island, and finally taking the wandering spirit of Parlevar and granting him the body of the first man. What followed shortly after was the Kangaroo, which Moinee made in Parlevar’s image, who then emerged from the soil in the ground. Droemerdene took the form of a star and acted as humanity’s guide and transformed these kangaroo-men into human beings; removing their tales and fashioning knees so they may rest. The original human beings were Palawa, and hence any who resist the Palawa identity are merely denying their ancestors."
 PLW_writers: "First Aboriginal Writers"
 PLW_writers_desc: "Though Aboriginal cultures were often defined through oral tradition and visual arts, we Palawa were among the first to adopt the written word as a way of preserving the legacy of the ancestors and sharing the knowledge of our people. Our earliest works included information about the island itself, our history, and great works of poetry written in Palawa languages. Our quick mastery of the written word is a clear demonstration that we Palawa are expert at embracing new ideas and shifting our old traditions to flow with the changing times."
 PLW_survivors: "Survivors of the Black War"
 PLW_survivors_desc: "When the colonists came to our island, they sought to eradicate our people and take our lands. The conflict was bloody, and almost eradicated all life on our island. We fought bravely against a superior foe; refusing to back down with gun barrels pointed to our heads."
 PLW_enduring: "Enduring People"
 PLW_enduring_desc: "After the bloody conflicts with foreign colonial armies, only four hundred Palawa were left alive to continue our legacy. Over the years, our numbers would begin to multiply again until we regained our original population. Although the scars of what was done to our people may never heal, we will always be able to stand up from even the bloodiest of conflicts and recover the numbers we lost in one-sided conflict."

The merchants of Makassar come seeking Australia’s most coveted goods; sea cucumbers, clothing, and tobacco. While others would remain insular and trade only with the locals, the Larrakian goods are carried all the way to the distant shores of China."
 LAR_federation: "The Larrakia Federation"

 LAR_dreaming: "Larrakia Dreaming"
 LAR_dreaming_desc: "The Dreaming Stories of the Larrakia make our lands every bit a part of our nation as our people. Our connection to the earth and seas we inhabit is every bit as spiritual as it is physical, and all across the shores of Northern Australia, we tell the Dreaming Stories that shaped the world."
 LAR_dowed: "Dowed"
 LAR_dowed_desc: "The first Larrakia man, Dowed was raised from the Earth by Nanganburra and educated in how to procreate, create law, and to speak. When he grew old, many refused to obey him and the laws he created, and his punishments caused many people to die. Through Dowed we learn the delicate balance between legalism and mercy."
 LAR_ceremonial_scarring: "Ceremonial Scarring"
 LAR_ceremonial_scarring_desc: "Scarring in Larrakia society is a voluntary act that one inflicts upon one’s body. The body is cut and scarred to celebrate marriage, the birth of children, or the death of a celebrated family member. To be scarred is to have a life of memories, and to be clean is to be naive and inexperienced, and the more clean one’s skin is, the less right they have to take part in ceremonies and celebrations."
 LAR_hospitality: "Larrakia Hospitality"
 LAR_hospitality_desc: "When strangers appear on the shores of Larrakia, whether they be friend or foe, they are treated with hospitality and respect, no matter their origins or intentions.

 LAR_kenbi_land_claim: "The Kenbi Land Claim"
 LAR_kenbi_land_claim_desc: "When colonizers came to the shores of Australia and illegally plundered and pillaged the lands of the Larrakia, we retaliated in the only language they understood; the language of the law. We laid out, in a three-meter-long document, the precise reasoning why the colonial companies were violating international laws, and our mastery of the law makes us a formidable opponent for any would-be colonizer."

 GMI_matrilineal_lineage: "Matrilineal Lineage"
 GMI_matrilineal_lineage_desc: "It is from our mothers’ womb that we are born, so it is by our mothers’ blood that we track our lineage.

By tracking lineage matrilineally, we always know where our blood has come from."
 GMI_familial_law: "Familial Law"
 GMI_familial_law_desc: "The norms of one’s kin dictate the behavior and obligations one owes to their family. In Kamilaroi society, laws exist on a national, tribal, and familial level and differentiate for each family. One’s family head is as much one’s master as one’s chief."

 HOLY_SITE_441_DESC: "It is said that the prophet Zaratushtra was born in Khorezm and therefore the region and, especially, the ancient city of Khiva, center of it, are considered sacred as the motherland of Zoroastrianism.

 HOLY_SITE_2212_DESC: "Since the times of the Sasanian Empire, on top of the mountains close to the city of Zanjan burned Adur Gushnasp, a fire of the highest grade. Although the temple was sacked by the Byzantines, its fire was saved by the faithful, but its light was made dark during the following Muslim invasions and consequent persecution. Now the fire burns brightly again in its sacred place linked once more to the warrior class, and it attracts pilgrims from all over."
 HOLY_SITE_4430_DESC: "When the Khorezm fell to the muslim forces, some worshipers fled to India and founded a community in Sanjan, carrying a sacred fire with them. A silsila, or traditional link, was formed between this new community and the original one in Persia from where the name Sanjan came from. Since 1297, the fire has moved around, first to the Bahrot Caves, then to the village of Bansda and finally to Navsari."

It tells of a hero from Hawaiki who set off on a voyage with his wife Kuramarotini in her great canoe, Matawhourua. On their legendary voyage they encountered countless sea monsters, demons, and harsh weathers before discovering the incredible land of Aotearoa. Upon returning to Hawaiki, he told his people of the incredible things he saw, and that a new life waited for them on these distant shores. It is from these enraptured listeners that we are descended, and the voyager spirit is something that exists at the very heart of our people."

One who practices this tradition is Kaitiaki or guardian and is a sacred guardian who defends the inanimate forces of Mana that surround us but are incapable of defending themselves. To desecrate a holy site is considered equivalent to murder in Maori society, so harmful acts such as polluting a river, chopping down a forest, or excessively plundering natural resources are considered sin without measure. It is only by living in harmony with our environment and restricting ourselves on how much we encroach on nature is the only way to please the Gods and grow rich with Mana."

Just as Victoria ruled over all the Brits, this king would rule over all the Maori and allow equal negotiations with the Europeans with a unified voice."

It was when they reached our island that they split into two tribes, Lutunasobasoba becoming chief of the West, and Degel chief of the East."
 fijian_conjoined: "Conjoined Society"
 fijian_conjoined_desc: "It has been said that Fijian society and religion are conjoined, and that any attempt to separate the two would result in irreparable damage to them both. While the separation of church and state may sound progressive in theory, in reality the very laws which govern our daily lives come from the wisdom of the great prophets and the Gods. While we accept cultures different from our own, if these people are to live here, they must come to understand our Gods and spirits if they are to call themselves Fijian."
 fijian_waqa: "Waqa Drua"
 fijian_waqa_desc: "The Drua is a canoe designed by our ancestors to carry our people across the ocean and wage war at sea. The Waqa Drua is the largest and finest seafaring vessel in all the known world, and other kingdoms tremble as they witness our vast ship's approach. Our mastery of ship craft and naval warfare has kept Fiji safe from foreign invaders, and so long as our mighty oceangoing armies maintain our long naval tradition, Fiji shall maintain its sovereignty."
 fijian_warlords: "Fijian Warlords"
 fijian_warlords_desc: "The mountainous nature of our islands have made it difficult to consolidate the different clans together and due to this fragmentation, fights over the territory are a constant thing. This means that a part of our society is constantly clashing other groups, so they are used to war."
 fijian_kai: "Kai Colo"
 fijian_kai_desc: "We are hardy people, our warriors train in the harsh mountain climates of Fiji. Kai Colo are the mountainous people of Fiji and produce the finest and hardiest warriors our islands have to offer. We do not suffer in the face of adverse climates, and we are adaptable to all terrain. During the war, the Kai Colo held out in their mountainous homes against a foe far more advanced than them. This was a battle that determined the continued existence of the Kai Colo, and unsurprisingly, our superior warriors won out in the end."
 fijian_confederacy: "Confederacy of Kingdoms"
 fijian_confederacy_desc: "When we Fijians were coming to formalize our disparate governments, one such proposal was that all existing kingdoms of Fiji be unified into a Confederacy of Kings, each holding some autonomy while still being unified under a single governing body. This method of granting our people local autonomy promotes local trade and creates a more prospering society for all."

 kapu_system: "Preserving the Kapu System"
 kapu_system_desc: "The Kapu system is the ancient Hawaiian system of laws which rule lifestyle, gender roles, religion, and the governing of the isles. The Kapu is a religious law, and enforces the will of the Gods upon the people. It also protects the holy sites of Hawaii and prevents the afforestation and plundering of our nation's precious resources for expedient pleasure. None are exempt from the Kapu; not commoners, not merchants, not foreign visitors, and not even the King."
 alii_nui: "Repurposing the Ali'i Nui"
 alii_nui_desc: "The Ali'i are the ruling class of Hawaii, and the Ali'i Nui is the individual who rules the ruling class. The Ali'i Nui were for a long time considered the highest members of society, with no individuals or institutions outranking them. With the unification of Hawaii, we cannot simply depose the old rulers of these regions, but rather we can redefine the meaning of Ali'i Nui into a secular position appointed by the King of Hawaii, solidifying our position without upsetting the Ali'i."
 hula_idea: "Hula"
 hula_idea_desc: "The Hula is a traditional dance often accompanied by an Oli Chant of a Mele Song. The Hula is more than a mere dance or performance, however. It is the medium by which we preserve our history, our culture, and tell stories of our ancestors and gods. The Oli or Mele describes the events as they happened with words, and the Hula translates those words into physical movement. The movement of our bodies and hands represent the literal words spoken or sung by the Oli and Mele, but also may represent the events of the story such as the flowing of the waves or the intense emotions of the legendary heroes of old."
 ohana: "Ohana"
 ohana_desc: "Ohana is the Hawaiian concept of family, and has long extended beyond mere blood relation. A family takes many forms, and adopted family is of equal importance to blood family. It was common practice for a great ruler to adopt trusted friends and allies into his or her family and treat them as kin, and our malleable concept of family makes Hawaiian society one which may welcome foreigners and strangers with brotherly arms."
 kanawai_mamalahoe: "Kanawai Mamalahoe"
 kanawai_mamalahoe_desc: "'Oh people, Honor thy god; respect alike people both great and humble; May everyone, from the old men and women to the children Be free to go forth and lie in the road Without fear of harm. Break this law, and die.' This is the Law of the Splintered Paddle laid out by King Kamehameha, and is the backbone of our society. The law is revolutionary and values the sanctity of all Human life, even that of our enemies, ensuring that the weak and innocent are protected from the devastation and hardships of war."
 naha_prophecy: "Naha Prophecy"
 naha_prophecy_desc: "The Naha Prophecy dictates that the man or woman who can lift the Naha Stone is the rightful ruler of all Polynesia. Our ruler has fulfilled this prophecy, and while some may deny our right to rule Polynesia, they will soon know that the divine blood of our royal line has long been destined to unite our people as one, and bring Polynesia to global prominence."
 legendary_voyagers: "Legendary Voyagers"
 legendary_voyagers_desc: "The sheer number of ancestors across Polynesia who claim they originated from Hawaii are too many to count. It can't be denied that voyaging, exploration, and colonization is in the very blood of the Hawaiian people. We hear the open ocean calling us, and we obey. Using the ancient navigational techniques of following the migration of birds and the positions of the stars in the sky, we Hawaiians can venture to the edge of the Earth and back, bringing knowledge and riches back to the shores of our magnificent home."

 tonga_tangaloa: "The Tangaloa Mythos"
 tonga_tangaloa_desc: "Tangaloa is a family of Gods of great importance to our people. The first member of the Tangaloa dynasty was Eiki; a cousin to the creator God Havea Hikule'o and the champion of Humanity: Maui. There are many stories of the exploits of the great Tangaloa family; including the hero Eitumapu'a who climbed a great ironwood tree into the skies and found the love of his life Ilaheva and slept beside her until the two islands Tala-kite and Mata-aho was forged from their love."
 tonga_pulotu: "Pulotu's Creation"
 tonga_pulotu_desc: "In the beginning, Pulotu pulled the great rock Touia'o Futuna from the infinite plane of ocean. On this new land emerged four sets of twins of opposite sexes, and each brother laid with his sister and their divine blood would produce four holy daughters. Our most ancient of ancestors bind all people together, and what better nation to keep the descendants of these people alive than the Tonga? Surely, our network of tributaries and subjects will understand that it is our brotherly and sisterly love of one-another that brings us closest to the ancient gods and ancestors."
 tonga_maui: "The Islands of Maui"
 tonga_maui_desc: "It is from Manuka in Samoa where Maui would receive his legendary fishing hook from none other than Tonga Fusifonua. When the great hero Maui went to fish in the ocean with this hook, he did not pull a fish from the ocean, but our home island of Tongatapu was dragged up from the bottom of the sea! As Maui continued to fish with this magical hook, he birthed ‘Eua and the many other smaller islands of our great kingdom, and even some of the isles of Fiji and Samoa as well. But it is Tongatapu, the capital island of our nation, that was the first of Maui's islands, and surely the divine nature of our land's birth that will attract even more merchants, settlers, and nobles to our shores."
 tonga_polynesian: "True Claimants to Polynesia"
 tonga_polynesian_desc: "While the other pacific Islanders embrace the winds of change as foreigners come to our shores, or indeed we come to foreign shores, we do not cave to the ways of others. As Tongans, we stand proud of our voyaging heritage, and remain as headstrong and resilient as a rock in the face of changing tides. We shall ensure our people continue to keep the Tongan identity alive."
 tonga_tongatapu: "The Bells of Tongatapu"
 tonga_tongatapu_desc: "We boast the highest ratio of people-to-temples in all the world. As one sails close to the shores of Tongatapu, among the whispering of the waves, one can hear the chime of bells and the gentle prayers of the faithful. Whether we choose to practice our old religion, or the emerging faiths from overseas, our faith shall bind us Tongans together, and everyone shall have a place to properly worship their gods."
 tonga_craftsman: "Ancient Tongan Craftsmanship"
 tonga_craftsman_desc: "We have an ancient tradition of bone carving, wood carving, and basket making. Our practices predate any records, and our great craftsmen have passed their trade down from generation to generation for so long that one could believe it is in our very blood."
 tonga_oceanic_empire: "The Oceanic Empire"
 tonga_oceanic_empire_desc: "Tonga is home to over 170 islands, with a people all connected by our ancient traditions and customs. Beyond that, the Tongan Empire collects its tributes from Samoa and Fiji, and many nations beyond our shores. With the brilliance and ingenuity we possess to keep a people unified across such an endless ocean, there is no nation better than the Tongan Empire to spread out across Oceania."

Music is a universal language all people understand, and it is with our mastery of the musical language that we shall find unity."
 samoa_faa: "Fa'a Samoa"
 samoa_faa_desc: "Fa'a Samoa is the ancient guideline for all Samoans on how to lead their lives, and how to rule their people.  The three structural elements of Fa'a Samoa liein the Matai or nobility, Aiga or family, and the clergy. There are over 18,000 noble families living on our various islands, and all follow the simple philosophy of Fa'a Samoa. It was by codifying what it means to be Samoan that we can maintain a kingdom that spans countless disparate islands across the sea."
 samoa_mauluulu: "Maulu'ulu"
 samoa_mauluulu_desc: "The Maulu'ulu is an ancient traditional dance practiced primarily by Samoan women, although many villages would have the men and women dance together. The dance is an artistic expression of everyday life in Samoa; imitating the motions of domestic duties, farming, fishing, and traditional customs. It is with this that we bind the activities of everyday life to our culture and make them transcendent."
 samoa_foreign: "Acceptance of the Foreign Missionaries"
 samoa_foreign_desc: "Although we wish to preserve our culture and heritage, it is irrefutable that these missionaries and prophets that come from overseas carry with them wisdom far beyond what we already possess. Perhaps by allowing them to stay and practice their ways, we may absorb some of that wisdom into our own society. A little western influence couldn't hurt. "
 samoa_tatau: "Tatau"
 samoa_tatau_desc: "The ancient art of the Tatau is practiced widely throughout the Polynesian Triangle. Master Tatau artists practice their craft with tools made from bones, tusk, teeth, shell, and wood. The process is long, arduous, and painful, but we do it to decorate our bodies with venerations to our ancestors and gods; showing a man's spirituality and commitment to the Samoan way of life."
 samoa_faavae: "Fa'avae I Le Atua Samoa"
 samoa_faavae_desc: "The religious practices of our people vary wildly in doctrine and denomination, but all are bound by the phrase “Samoa is founded on God”. It matters not what religion we practice, for it is Samoa itself which is holy among all gods. Sunday is a day of great rest for all Samoans, to worship their respective gods in the way they choose and spend time amongst their family. It matters not what faith you follow, for all are accepted in Fa'a Samoa."
 samoa_trade: "Polynesian Triangle Trade"
 samoa_trade_desc: "For years, Samoan traders have been involved in trading across the Polynesian Triangle; primarily with Fiji and Tonga, our close neighbors. Many societies would merely abandon the notion of trade across such a vast ocean, but our voyagers and traders understand the way of the waves better than any others. No matter the size of our nation, we shall remember the navigational techniques that brought riches to Samoa, and perhaps someday Samoa will reap the rich trade goods from all over the world…"

Laulima is the second value of the Ahupua'a system, and it dictates cooperation. Laulima literally means many hands, and describes the manner in which every Hawaiian contributes towards the success of the Kingdom and that performing one's duties and cooperating with others is in everyone's best interest. Malama is the final value of the Ahupua'a system, and it describes stewardship. One who practices Malama is attentive, caring, and observant and cares for their community and their family.

Some guards tried to stop [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], but with a gesture of the hand, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] told them to leave [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] alone. A few hours later, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] came back with a big smile in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] face.\n'I talked to a Menehune tonight' [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] claimed.

 estate_regency_events.1.d: "During the last few months, a faction in our realm has been gaining strength, and they see themselves as the leaders that should rule during this regency. Their demands started as gossip; someone whispers that this or that person is not happy with the direction of the nation, another says that the leading faction is not as strong as this other, or that they are not as represented in the regency as they should and so on. Those gossips have continued for weeks and their presence in the court is totally obvious nowadays, to the point that the faction challenging our regent's power is absolutely vocal about it. The regent is worried, for obvious reasons, and sees that [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] own faction's power has been weakened to the point of doubting that it can fight back. It is the moment to make a decision that will change our nation."

Unchallenged and drunk with power, the faction behind our regent, and probably [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] too, is pressing to be granted some privileges. As we are in a position of weakness, refusing to accept their demands can be a dangerous move, and we might be choosing a path to our own damnation. On the other hand, if they managed to cement their power, they might be difficult to remove, should they refuse to step away from lead once we have a proper ruler."

Our regent, [Root.Monarch.GetName], thinks being in power is a golden opportunity to get rid of some political enemies and adversaries. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] is using [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] power as a regent to mercilessly attack any voice that speaks against [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] or [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] faction or even when they do not, just because [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] can. Of course, the other factions are not specially happy with how things are being done and might try to retaliate. We are in a crossroad where we have to decide what to do, should we intervene?"

[Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] faction have used their power to further advance some shady businesses while they are in power. Smuggling is nothing new to us, we know it and it would not be the first time we turn our eyes blind to this, but this time these illicit moves have irritated another nation, and they might use this incident as an excuse to declare war on us and get some compensations. Unfortunately, they are not willing to negotiate."

And this is exactly the situation [Root.GetName] is facing. The clergy in charge is using their power to remove the influence of other religions in our realm and their power is too big to refuse. A timid protest is all we have been able to elevate. We will change this policy in the future, no doubt, but for now we will need to live with it."

[Root.Monarch.GetName] is an exception to the rule.

For months, the regent has taken a lot of time to share [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] wisdom to [Root.Heir.GetName] and both have enjoyed this time greatly. The preparation to be a ruler is never easy, but [Root.Monarch.GetName] has done a great work.

And so he returns. And when he returns all the birds in the village have grown flowers in their mouths, their singing voices forever muted - silence is restored again.
