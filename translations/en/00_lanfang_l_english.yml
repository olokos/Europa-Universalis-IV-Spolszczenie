 majapahit.1.t: "A Hero Emerges"
 majapahit.1.d: "The prime minister's nephew arrived at our court not long ago, everything about him was completely unknown but his name - Damarwulan. He served us as a stableboy, but soon the rumors of his natural beauty reached the prime minister's daughter and there are few fires harder to extinguish than young love.\nThe fate that awaits him for his affront should be clear as a summer day, however, our ruler [Root.Monarch.GetName] has woke up at night, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] face drenched in sweat, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] eyes wider than suns: \"I had a dream,\" [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] announces, \"that a young man named Damarwulan saved our kingdom.\""
 majapahit.1.a: "Perhaps he is our savior."
 majapahit.1.b: "Banish him for his crime."
 damarwulan_tt: "§YDamarwulan§! must win §Y5§! battles against the enemies of §YMajapahit§!."
 majapahit.2.t: "Damarwulan's Victory"
 majapahit.2.d: "It never gets any easier. Rotten blood still reeks as one's own, the enemies' eyes are still human eyes, the night before the battle still keeps Damarwulan wide awake.\nThe battle ends victoriously, like any other battle has before for him. This is the fifth battle, and he wishes five is the final number. When he returns to court, he is received with the greatest of honors, his name repeated so many times that he forgets it is his name and thinks it is just another word for \"victory\". [Root.Monarch.GetName] approaches him, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] heart filled with joy. \"Young Damarwulan,\" [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] says, \"you are not that young anymore.\""
 majapahit.2.a: "He shall become our Consort."
 majapahit.2.b: "He shall become the heir to [Root.GetName]."
 majapahit.2.c: "He shall be greatly honored."
 majapahit.3.t: "The Fall of Majapahit"
 majapahit.3.d: "Majapahit is an empire in its death throes. Once the center of a vast network of vassal kingdoms and tributary states, Majapahit now has little power beyond [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]. Chinese support for our rivals in Malacca as well as the rising power of Brunei have led to the collapse of our hegemony. Worse, internal struggles over the succession threaten to tear the remnants of the empire apart from the inside."
 majapahit.3.a: "These are dark times."
 majapahit.4.t: "A New Dawn for [Root.GetName]"
 majapahit.4.d: "Against all odds, [Root.GetName] has emerged from decades of turmoil and decline as a newly resurgent power. A stable [Root.GovernmentName], loyal subjects, and a common faith bolster our resolve as we remember Gajah Mada’s oath: that one day Majapahit will rule all of Nusantara."
 majapahit.4.a: "We have returned from the brink."
 majapahit.5.t: "The Rise of Demak"
 majapahit.5.d: "The increasingly autonomous Muslim community in Demak have found a champion in the renegade Majapahit prince [Root.demak_sultan.GetName].  [Root.demak_sultan.GetName] has not only declared the independence of the Demak Sultanate, but also seeks to seize the throne of Majapahit for himself. Bound by our many struggles, there is little that we can do while Demak gathers its strength."
 majapahit.5.a: "Traitors!"
 majapahit.6.t: "The Rise of Mataram"
 majapahit.6.d: "Majapahit has proven itself unable to govern even its holdings on Java. A rival state, calling itself the Sultanate of Mataram, has emerged on the southern part of the island and has laid claim to the legacy of the empire. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] can do little but watch as [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] empire collapses around [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]."
 majapahit.7.t: "Disloyalty to Majapahit"
 majapahit.7.d: "The rulers of [maj_tributary_country.GetName] have been increasingly ignoring [Root.GetAdjective] rule. They have now crossed the line into outright defiance, withholding tribute and disrespecting our emissaries."
 majapahit.7.a: "They will regret this."
 majapahit.7.b: "Make concessions to restore their loyalty."
 majapahit.8.t: "[Root.maj_pretender.GetName] Challenges the Throne"
 majapahit.8.d: "Struggles over the succession have become commonplace in [Root.GetName]. On this occasion a Prince named [Root.maj_pretender.GetName] has gathered an army and begun his march to the capital to overthrow the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 majapahit.8.a: "We will crush this upstart."
 majapahit.9.t: "An Offer of Aid"
 majapahit.9.d: "The situation in [Root.GetName] is dire, but it seems that all is not lost yet. A group of wealthy Muslim merchants have approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] with an offer. They will pay us handsomely for trading privileges in our ports and the right to practice their religion freely with [Root.GetName]. The Bhattara Saptaprabhu warn that the instability of the empire may attract our people to the merchant’s foreign faith, discarding the founding traditions of the Majapahit empire. Silver, however, makes for its own counter-argument."
 majapahit.9.a: "Their help is most welcome."
 majapahit.9.b: "We do not need aid from heathens. Banish them."
 maj_muslim_traders_tt: "§YThe merchants will evangelize their Sunni faith in our provinces§!"
 majapahit.10.t: "Spread of Islam in [maj_sunni_province.GetName]"
 majapahit.10.d: "Muslim communities have existed in Majapahit since at least the time of Zheng He. Through trade, through the movement of peoples, and through proselytization these communities have grown ever larger. In these dark times, Islam offers solace and stability to communities that can no longer rely on the state to protect them. In [maj_sunni_province.GetName] the people have widely accepted Sunni Islam to the detriment of traditional Hindu-Buddhism."
