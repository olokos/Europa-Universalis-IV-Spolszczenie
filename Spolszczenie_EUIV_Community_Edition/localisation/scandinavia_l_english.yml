Our kontor (entrepôt) in their country was thus a key source of wealth for the League. Recent developments in the diplomatic and geographical front have resulted in our merchants regaining their long-lost offices in Veliky Novgorod!"

 flavor_hsa.6.d:0 "The presence of large schools of herring fish around the Falsterbo peninsula is legendary. For ages our people spoke of tales about the overabundance of them, as our fishermen provided our folk with valuable and fresh merchandise. Such abundance of easily obtainable fish has been providing the markets in and around Skane, being the source of great wealth for all merchants involved in the herring trade.\n\nEmbarking on the market as a competitor to Skane would probably prove to be very profitable. However, despite the abundance of marine life in the pass, many advisors in our court suggest we best stay loyal to our main export, Lubeckian naval supplies."

It quickly became a very important trading center, dominating the trade along the Norwegian coast. However, since then the League's influence in the city had dwindled, its offices and storehouses being taken by local merhants.\n\nAround [GetYear], an office of the Hanseatic League was re-established in the city. As the area once again regained its importance as a trading centre for the League, the facilities around the port, including the warfs and storage buildings, flourished and were greatly expanded in an attempt to provide mercantile capacity to the new influx of traders."

 flavor_hsa.8.d:0 "The natural harbor of Visby has for long been an important trade center of the Baltic.

Simultaneously, the city hosts an impressive set of fortifications, further improving the image of a sturdy and dependable mercantile destination."

 flavor_hsa.9.d:0 "Originally formed on 21 February 1440 at Marienwerder by a group of nobles and clergy of several cities in Prussia as opposition to the mercantile regulations imposed by the Teutonic Knights, the Danzig Confederation quickly became a powerful player in the internal politics of the region. Eventually, they would go on to seek the protection of the Polish King as the latter took up arms against the Teutons.\n\nDespite the conflicts between the aforementioned parties, Danzig now lies within our sphere of influence. As a result, the merchants of the City and members of the Confederation have come to our court in Lübeck to barter and ask for access to our prosperous markets."

This makes the presence of city walls not just a necessity, but a vital part of the existence of the city itself. Fortunately enough, we haven't been slackening in our duty to ensure the safety of our city and wealth, and the impressive fortifications surrounding it are a testament to that. The multiple walls and gates surrounding our city will make sure that nobody dares try to attack us to steal our wealth."

 flavor_hsa.12.d:0 "Mercantilism was an economic theory and practice prevalent in Europe from the 16th to the 18th centuries. It emphasized the accumulation of wealth through a favorable balance of trade, primarily through exports. Governments actively promoted exports and discouraged imports through various measures like tariffs and subsidies. The goal was to increase a nation's wealth and power by accumulating gold and silver and building a strong domestic industry while eliminating foreign competition."

 flavor_hsa.13.d:0 "To facilitate our efforts in our mercantile adventures, we will need the proper infrastructure and vehicles to move our merchandise. Thus, for the purpose of trading, we shall adopt the Hanseatic Cog, a bulky freighter with one mast and a square sail. The ship will become the symbol of financial prowess and affluence, traversing the sealanes and connecting our many ports!"

Even our most powerful and navally capable foes will tremble at her size and firepower as she gracefully takes to the seas!\n\nSuch naval prowess displayed by Adler will certainly be the object of envy in the eyes of our rivals. To safeguard its legitimacy and aura of invincibility would mean that our nation will continue to benefit from its glorious name."

 flavor_hsa.20.d:0 "The regulation of timber and workforce in the maritime sector was once the lifeblood of our great republic. During the early 15th century however, we lost the monopoly on shipbuilding and the goods associated to it and thus lost the firm grasp on the seas themselves. Despite numerous setbacks the Hansa has recently rediscovered its long-lost power in the trade of naval supplies by re-establishing control over the markets of our home city and abroad. What this means for our future not many can clearly say, but the positive development of our city returning to its roots is certainly a sign of prosperous times to come!"

One such prominent individual is Georg Giese, a talented merchant from Danzig who has been managing his family office in our London kontor for years.

Now that he has come back from London it seems that we can use his great potential in a more direct way."

Many merchants have come and gone, some more gifted at making legendary fortunes and securing themselves a spot at the pages of history and others less so. \n\nFew however, have left such a dent in history as Albrecht Moldenhauer, a genius merchant from our city of Lübeck. He has been crucial in the development of trade with Sweden and Norway, and thanks to him goods flowing through both countries have been greatly increased. We can no doubt use talented individuals like him."

Recently, we have been approached by foreign agents purporting to be messengers of the rebelling factions in the court of Denmark. They suggest that a monetary donation of a certain magnitude would assist them in their endeavours against their tyrannical overlord. Whatever the case may be, this could be our chance to mingle in Danish politics and weaken their crown authority!"

 flavor_hsa.24.d:0 "Many factors certainly have contributed to the downfall of the Hanseatic League during the first half of the 15th century. Be it disease, misfortune, divine retribution or the Bullion Famine, our court lost its old splendor and its standing as a powerful mercantile union of hundreds of merchants across the germanic cities and beyond. In its stead, the scheming merchants of the Dutch court attempt to usurp our position and surpass us in terms of influence across the markets of Europe. Such behavior is no less the grounds for just wars and these petty men of Holland must be put in their place lest we risk inevitable demise."
 flavor_hsa.24.a:0 "We will have their heads for this!"
 flavor_hsa.25.t:0 "Hans Holbein the Younger"
 flavor_hsa.25.d:0 "It is truly a captivating view, to trace the ripples of important historical events such as the Renaissance. Hans Holbein is a German painter and printmaker who worked in a Northern Renaissance style becoming one of the most prominent figures of this style during the 16th century. Distinguished from his father, he initially worked in Basel, blending Late Gothic and Renaissance influences to create his unique aesthetic. After gaining recognition in England through his association with humanist figures like Thomas More, Holbein became the King's Painter to Henry VIII, producing remarkable portraits that captured both likeness and profound symbolism. His art, renowned for its precision and depth, continues to fascinate scholars and is considered a pinnacle of portraiture for its insightful depiction of character and elegant style."

Despite several setbacks and the machinations of our enemies, we have managed to not only come out on top but to also reinforce the values of our Trade League. Dominating in the most important markets from Norway to the Baltic we have proved our naysayers wrong, elevating the status of our great nation to never-before-seen heights!
