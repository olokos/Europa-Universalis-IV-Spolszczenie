(later known as §YKing Taejo§!) in 1392. From the start, Joseon Korea's connection to §YMing China§! was strong: When settling on a name for the new kingdom, Taejo submitted the options 'Hwaryeong' and 'Joseon' to Ming and decided on the latter after its endorsement by the Emperor.\n\nThis close connection to §YMing China§! was to remain until the downfall of the Ming in the mid-17th century - as was Korea's subordinate status in the relationship. As followers of §YConfucianism§!, Koreans viewed China as being at the heart of the Korean world, and Joseon Korea came to be in some ways even more sinicized than China itself - a 'little China'. For their part, the Chinese viewed Joseon Korea as the 'country of courteous people in the East'. For as long as Ming remains the undisputed claimant to the §YMandate of Heaven§!, the maintenance of these strong bonds will remain vital to the survival of the fledgling Korean kingdom.\n\nThe achievements of the first century of §YJoseon§! rule were considerable. In the early 15th century, the border regions of §YGyeongseong§! and §YYukjin§! were taken from the §YJurchens§!, allowing the Koreans to unite the territory which would form modern-day Korea. There was also a flourishing of academia and knowledge. In particular, the hangul alphabet was introduced in 1446. Unlike the Chinese alphabet, it was designed to be both easy to learn and easy to adapt to the Korean language, making its use far more convenient and allowing a far broader section of society to read scholarly texts. Further notable progress was made in the fields of agriculture, gunpowder and the codification of the law, and major efforts were made to survey and record the geography of the land.\n\nHowever, threats to the Korean kingdom remain from both within and beyond its borders. At home, Korea's peasants remain poor, and both §Ypeasant uprisings§! and insufficient tax receipts are likely to become a problem if nothing is done to rectify the situation. Furthermore, although the upper class of §Yyangban elites§! has for the most part been united, the cracks in this façade are already beginning to show and could erupt into §Yfactional strife§! at any time.\n\nOn the foreign front lie threats aplenty. To the north await the warlike §YJurchens§! - although presently divided, should they come to be unified under a strong leader, an invasion of Korea might follow swiftly. Similarly, across the sea to the east lies §YJapan§!, a nation of warring §Ydaimyos§! and would-be §Yshoguns§!. Korea must be vigilant, lest a united Japan seek to expand its power across the narrow channel of the Korean Sea. Finally, although Korea basks in the shadow of the §YMing Empire§!, woe betide the Joseon prince who wakes the dragon!"
