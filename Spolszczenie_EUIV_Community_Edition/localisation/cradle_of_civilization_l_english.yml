In fact, by paying retroactively many also avoid the strain of paying for the fallen.\nAs [From.GetCapitalName] fell it was therefore expected that our soldiers be allowed to loot the city to enrich themselves. What was less expected was the total and utter destruction of the city that took place. Refusing to follow orders our men descended upon the helpless burghers, doing despicable things and ruining the area for a long time to come."

This would, according to our generals, lead to an increase in quality and make us less vulnerable to things we cannot control.

One such inspection in [cheating_rolls.GetName] has unearthed quite a local scandal.

Manifesting piety in other ways such as dance, singing and by blending the Islamic traditions with local ones, the Sufis are not always at the best term with the religious establishment.\nA sufi leader has managed to get quite a following in [sufi_province.GetName], with a great number of [sufi_province.Religion.GetName] converts joining his disciples. His followers are clearing land for new settlements where they might live together and this could well lead to a much greater Islamic influence in the entire area.

 muslim_school_events.10.d:0 "Not all theologians agree. Normally this is not much of a problem, as disagreement can exist without problem in the scholarly world.

 muslim_school_events.11.t:0 "Playing the Courts"
 muslim_school_events.11.d:0 "While the [Root.GetReligiousSchool] school is the officially sanctioned school of the [Root.GovernmentName] there are many courts and Qadis throughout our lands and all four of the schools of faith are deemed appropriate for civil procedures. This means that to some extent it is possible to 'play the courts' by bringing a case before a Qadi of a school considered more likely to give a beneficial ruling to a specific case.\nAn entrepreneuring merchant in [shiites_here.GetCapitalName] has become so good at this that it has angered not only the local population and his business competitors, but also the local governor. There is not much we can do about this without making inroads into the privileges of the Ulema."

 muslim_school_events.13.t:0 "Protests in [protest_province.GetName]"
 muslim_school_events.13.d:0 "As men of great spiritual strength, but also firmly part of the establishment, members of the Ulema sometimes choose to join social protests. A recent altercation between the local garrison and the urban population in [protest_province.GetName] have attracted the attention of prominent Mufti in the state of [protest_province.GetAreaName].\nOur local commander fears the situation might escalate unless we listen to the protesters, but doing so would come at a cost."
 muslim_school_events.13.a:0 "Let us compensate the people of [protest_province.GetName]."
 muslim_school_events.13.b:0 "Mufti or not, there is nothing we can do."
 muslim_school_events.14.t:0 "The poor of [urbanization_province.GetCapitalName]"
 muslim_school_events.14.d:0 "As cities grow, the old amenities and walls that once supported them decay. In [urbanization_province.GetCapitalName] this has over time led to change. Less clean workshops, such as those of tanners, have moved beyond the city walls, as have the cemeteries. Most visible, however, is the increasing number of poor in the streets. As existing charities have not been able to keep up with the rapid growth of the city, it has been suggested that we set aside more state property as Waqf, charitable donations for the upkeep of public soup kitchens and bath houses."
 muslim_school_events.14.a:0 "We will naturally support such a cause."
 muslim_school_events.14.b:0 "Surely local notables can afford charity out of their own pockets?"

 muslim_school_events.15.d:0 "As Custodians of the holy mosques of [holy_city.GetCapitalName] we are responsible not only for the Holy Shrine. A state that claims this honor is also expected to fend for both the population of the holy cities, as well as the pilgrims they attract. For this purpose many rulers have devoted great resources, both within the cities themselves and large tracts of faraway farmland, in order to feed and maintain the area.\nSome say [Root.Monarch.GetName] has not been paying the attention to these cities that they deserve, that pilgrims are no longer safe and that there is great want in the streets of [holy_city.GetCapitalName]."
 muslim_school_events.15.a:0 "Let us set aside more land for their upkeep."
 muslim_school_events.15.b:0 "Sadly we have no more resources to spare right now."
 muslim_school_events.16.t:0 "Expansion of the [madrasa_province.GetCapitalName] Madrasah"
 muslim_school_events.16.d:0 "The Madrasah of [madrasa_province.GetCapitalName] has been gaining repute, not only as a center of [Root.GetReligiousSchool] learning, but also for its Shiekhs from other schools. [Root.GetReligiousScholars] scholars from other parts of the world have in particular made a name for themselves at the [madrasa_province.GetCapitalName] Madrasah and as a result both the institution itself, the adjoining market district and the bustling city as a whole is growing rapidly.\nUrban growth is never without its problems, however, and a growing Madrasah still needs to be provided for. If the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] would set aside a larger charitable donation for the upkeep and maintenance of a greater Madrasah it would benefit both the city and the area at large."
 muslim_school_events.16.a:0 "We must contribute to this endeavor."

Pilgrims from various parts of the country are already starting to come to the province to see the shrine of this great man, some calling him a saint. Local notables have set aside a charitable donation its maintenance and his former pupils have opened a lodge nearby.\nWhile there is nothing wrong with honoring a great man, some more traditionalist among the pious and the Ulema feel that this form or worship is sacrilegious.\n Should [Root.Monarch.GetName] pay the shrine in [dargah_province.GetName] a visit it might do much, both for the prestige of the shrine itself but also for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] popular perception."

 muslim_school_events.18.t:0 "Alevis of [alevi_province.GetName]"
 muslim_school_events.18.d:0 "While they are not our direct brothers of faith, a great number among the Turkic tribesmen in Anatolia are Shia Alevis. Like the Jafari's the Alevis are twelvers and believe in the coming of the Twelve Imam. Their faith is also quite deeply entrenched in mysticism and Sufism. Under Sunni rule they have been forced to live a life in many ways secluded from society, they have not been allowed to intermarry the Sunnis and they have been distrusted by the state.\nMany among the people of [alevi_province.GetName] are Alevis and they have generally welcomed us as their new overlords. Their mystical traditions are in many ways different from ours but if we embraced these people we could likely spread the Shia faith much more quickly in the area."
 muslim_school_events.18.a:0 "Let us empower our brothers of faith in the area."

 muslim_school_events.19.t:0 "The Worldly Ulema"
 muslim_school_events.19.d:0 "Not all members of the Ulema are great theologians or intellectuals. Corruption can grow in any corner of the state and for some it can be hard to tell apart what benefits the faith and what might benefit themselves. It has come to the attention of [Root.Monarch.GetName] that a number of pious grants that exist around the empire have been obtained through fraud or illegally passed on to heirs. Our wazir has suggested that we inspect and verify all such grants in the [Root.GovernmentName], especially in regions that were not originally ruled by us.\nThis would clearly be a grave affront to the Ulema, however, who would see it as an encroachment on their privileges and an attack on their caste as a whole."

 muslim_school_events.21.d:0 "Many among the Ulema are increasingly unhappy with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Among pious Muslims, our inclusion of heathens in high offices as well as the adoption of heathen customs and traditions, is viewed with scorn. The intrusions of the state on interpretation of law and other traditional domains of the Ulema have also not earned the state any friends among the jurists of the realm.\nCharismatic Shiekhs of the Sufi Naqshbandi order have begun to agitate against the state what they consider a wrongful, and in some cases sinful implementation of Islamic law in our realm."
